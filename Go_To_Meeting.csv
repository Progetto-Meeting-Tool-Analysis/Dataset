With this solution I can keep meetings or presentations everywhere in the World where I have Internet connection.
The sound can be by Internet or phone call, I can share my screen ot my webcam, and aldo I can save the meeting, to keep track of it.",I've tried other solutions and for me the best from this solution is how easy is to access to the conference for my customer. Just one click and they are inside the conference.,"I would like to send invitations to my customers from the same interface instead than copy&paste the content of the access. It has plugins with main mail solutions like outlook and GMail, but sometimes because I am in a customer with firewall email rules that don't let me access to my server from outllok but only by webmail, I have to create the conference form one site copy&paste and send the invitations from my webmail."
1 Go_To_Meeting,Go_To_Meeting,Althea T.,MARBLE seller,Materiali da costruzione,6-12 mesi,5 /5,5 /5,4 /5,5 /5,5 /5,8/10,The best conference server I ever tried,8/11/2020,"Experience is some kind of perfect. Best audio, great image quality, great sound and possibility to share the screen, or share video, clip or files. You can stop your participation whenever you want, or go in pause if youâ€™re in need. Also you can write some public messages as for example questions about conversation . Just one counsel: when the owner talks, all the other participants is better if close them audio, or many sounds can disturb, and plus, they get ownerâ€™s voice low.","As the review title, I can confirm this is for me, the best conference support I ever tried. First motivation of all as that differently to the most of other, you can connect yourself either by pc or by phone. Sometimes it happened to me I had a conference to connect with, and I had to go office or home and get the access only and exclusively by pc, it was not a comfy way. So, then, the second motivation is, if for example you can t open your email and follow the link to access, no drama: you can also get in touch only digiting the access code. This is very useful because if for example you re not using your pc and you don t remember the password for open your mail account and follow the link, you can access in few se one in this way (it really happened to me, as I was on holiday and had to use a public pc, didn t recognize my mail password on that one pc, and it should be a stress sit if I couldnâ€™t t access in other way).","To be honest, I m sure that is the best software of category I can counsel. Maybe the only thing I would like to change is just for privacy, during conference open to many people (they can be at least 100 persons), I would be glade if my name was not viewed. But anyway, this is not a trouble of the software, but of the people who manage the conference, who some kind of ever ask to change the mail with the name, to be able of name you. Should be nice if GTM get you a nickname."

As I was looking for a product to deliver webinars and charge for events, I was promised the moon by sales reps that I later learned didnâ€™t understand the tool and gave me erroneous information.","Not much. I was able to offer webinars, but many of the features promised by sale reps didnâ€™t pan out or work as promised.","Poor integration with PayPal when selling events. Bugs in applications, things that worked only if you did an end run around a problem that went unfixed for the entire time I had the product."

The web audio has always been crystal clear, which is one of the most important aspects for effective virtual meetings. Our team has also been reall pleased with the ability to screen record. We will continue to use GoToMeeting over Zoom because it's always been reliable, safe, and extremely efficient, even before COVID-19. We have never have any issues with data privacy and GoToMeeting gives us that peace of mind that our conversations are secure and protected.","GoToMeeting is one of the quickest and most reliable virtual meeting tools available. We've been using GoToMeeting for years and it's always been very secure and safe to use at our agency. Unlike Zoom, we have never been hacked and find the quality and chat features on GoToMeeting very reliable. The admin dashboard provides very robust reporting, especially for time-tracking and monitoring within our agency and for grouping various teams together. You can use this tool to organize a meeting in just a matter of minutes and have peace of mind that your meeting space is protected and data secure.","The note-taking feature is extremely useful because we don't have to keep jumping back and forth to different screens to record meeting notes. However, it would be really nice if the note-taking feature could be part of the professional plan, especially during COVID-19. It seems like a feature that could be added on at no additional cost and that would be so useful to our teams."

It is a great meeting software and makes it easy for clients to use. It is secure and there are different methods to enter a meeting.",The best part about GoToMeeting is the hub and how it makes it so easy to view and schedule meetings. We also love the personalized meeting room for impromptu meetings.,The customer support could be a little better. There are times when they seem put off when we ask them questions. We would love to see some in meeting features being a little easier to use.

We've never been negatively impacted by and outages of their service and have found their pricing reasonable as our staff increases and our needs scale up.,"The ability for guests to join sessions without software downloads was a big deciding factor for us. We also have to keep branding uniform across users, so being able to set templates for the imaging when guests join us was an added bonus.",The staff that use G2M the most have asked over and over about hotkeys. Relying only on mouse input when hosting a session can draw attention and focus away from the subject. It would be great to be able to pause/play and enable the cursor tools on the fly with some keyboard shortcuts.

Hoping to get more from the platform after its acquisition from Cisco to include years of capabilities into this product.","The most important thing that I liked about this was that I was able to start using the product immediately and didn't had to wait for weeks for implementation. Secondly, the platform offers the flexibility to go for billing as yo require. The video quality was very good in low bandwidth as well. The platform offers mobile app to schedule and attend meetings on the go.",The scalability of the platform is not good when it comes to organizing meetings for more than 100/200 people and we were not comfortable with that.

This can be done on a pc, tablet or mobile device This is very convenient for staff that are unable to travel to the office. My overall experience is very positive and I would recommend to others.",This meeting platform is wonderful. It allows for meetings to be held with video capabilities. There are chat options that are very useful and hand raising button to create a respectful business meeting environment.,The only issue with the software is that it isn't well known. Many staff members have to be given directions on how to download. This software needs to be advertised more.

It is comparatively cheap and easy to use,"GoToMeeting is a great tool, all in one place to support Conference calls, meetings and recording. It provides a great range of toll free numbers and local numbers for number of people to Join from around the world.",GoToMeeting sometimes allow attendees to unmute themselves and show their webcam despite blocking/disabling it for attendees.
10 Go_To_Meeting,Go_To_Meeting,Ana B.,Architectural designer,Architettura e urbanistica,Più di 2 anni,5 /5,5 /5,4 /5,4 /5,5 /5,10/10,Must have conferencing tool but can be confusing,19/1/2020,"Overall this is an indispensable tool for me despite the bugs that might pop up, or because it makes it easier to conference with team members who are not able to be present at my meetings. It is also very helpful to attend a meeting when I am not able to attend in person, such as when I am sick but can not afford to miss out on a critical meeting.","This is a must have tool for participating in meetings that have people in different locations. You can speak to each other, see each other, and share screens, and this goes for having dozens of people in the meeting. It is easy to set up a reoccurring phone number and link to call in which is helpful if you have a project with reoccurring meetings. If you are a user calling in to a meeting the directions you follow are fairly easy to follow and understand when you are on your computer, which is usually the case for me and my colleagues. I will also say the sound quality is consistently high, compared to other competitors of Go To, and I appreciate the tools to help others follow along with where I am referencing on the screen share(pointer, highlighter etc)","It can be very difficult to call in to a meeting if you are just on your phone. It is not as simple as calling a number, you have to enter different codes and if you are driving or on the go it can be challenging to open your outlook calendar or email to find the code to enter, or if you have misplaced it you can have troubles getting in to the call. I wish there was a better system for calling in rather than dialing such long numbers into the phone several times. It can also be easy to confuse different meetings with one another and accidentally call in to a meeting you are not invited to, instead of your meeting you are late to, as all the meetings are essentially random phone numbers. I have also had several instances where I will conclude a meeting but still have the line open accidentally, and voices from a meeting not at my company will emerge from the phone, very strange. This could be more user friendly. I have had some glitches where people cannot hear me, people get dropped off the call, or the meeting will suddenly end due to error but this is very rare."
12 Go_To_Meeting,Go_To_Meeting,Arturo M.,Developer,Servizi e tecnologie dell'informazione,Più di 1 anno,5 /5,5 /5,4 /5,3 /5,4 /5,10/10,Pretty good conference software,21/9/2019,"The overall experience is really good; GTM runs flawlessly every time and it is full of options. The main con is just related to its price. However if you or your company can afford it, it is a really good option as a meeting software.","Gotomeeting is a pretty complete meeting software. It features the most common options on the majority of the meeting apps, such as allow to audo or video conferences, allow to share the screen or give control of you desktop to a participant of the meeting, record the sessions and so on.
Besides that it also offers some interesting options that in my opinion give GTM an extra value. One interesting feature is that the metings may have an owner that can set different level of permissions for the participants, allowing them to re-schedule the meetings of only participate as listeners but forbidding to talk. The meetings can be scheduled without need of a calendar app, so you can have your scheduled Daily scrum meeting and just need to access GTM to attend. It also count with Google Chrome plugin and a Google Calendar integration in case you're more comfortable that way. To invite people to a meeting is also really simple. It is possible to send a regular mail invitation, but it is also possiblo to do it by sharing a url link or the meeting Id number. Besides all these features, the audio/video quality is excellent, and I've never have a problem during a meeting.","Maybe the prices are a bit excesive for what it offers, since although other options may not have that many features, they are way more cheaper than GTM and this is the reason my company drop GTM some time ago when we started using G-suite, so we migrate to google meetings."

In my humble opinion, is one of the best meeting software I've ever used.","GoToMeeting deliver in general high quality in audio and videomeetings and most important provides really quick and easy way to setup meetings with your team or any other GTM user.
It has integration plugin for GCalendar, which makes really easy to setup a ""conference room"" for a scheduled meeting and invite multiple attendees.
The recording option really save your day when there are lots of topics to follow and no time for taking notes.
It also have interesting features as indicating who is talking both when you're using video and when is just an audio meeting, which at some points is also really useful when you don't actually know all the attendees. Beside this it provides also regular features as other meeting software like written chat, presenting mode, and so on.","The only bad experience I had with GTM is when the owner of a recurring meeting is on holiday or leave the company, was almost impossible to change the owner in order to modify the meeting or cancel it. Only contacting with the admin team solved these issues."

It's reliable and easy to use. We have tested out other meeting solutions including Zoom, but none compare to the ease of use found with GTM. Zoom meetings, for instance, have a much different interface, and very little is intuitive about the dashboard. Conversely, GoToMeeting's dashboard is easy to understand and follow. You can also easily change your user name within a meeting, so if you are on an informal meeting with team members you might just list your first name, whereas for a client meeting you can list your full name, title, etc.","Our organization has used GoToMeeting for many years. It is a solution that enables individuals to connect via a url to a virtual meeting. It is ideal for companies that have remote staff or staff that travel frequently and cannot physically attend a meeting. This is among GoToMeeting's best features. Other advantages include the following:
1. It's very easy to assign a permanent meeting url to your team members. This is a great feature, because nothing is more annoying than having to create new urls for meetings. With GoToMeeting, you can use the same url again and again.
2. It's very easy to assign meeting control (i.e., switch presenter) to other members in the meeting. This is especially helpful when presentations need to be shared with others. It's also a great way to perform edits to presentations in real-time with team members who are not physically next to you.
3. Users can share their web cams. We sometimes make this obligatory, as it helps to ensure that those in the meeting are actually paying attention and not multi-tasking.","You have to make sure to switch your audio depending on how you join the meeting. If you join by phone but forget to switch your GoToMeeting dashboard setting to phone audio, you (and others) will hear a loud, ongoing each until you make this switch. Ideally GoToMeeting would recognize the source from which you are joining (phone or computer audio) but since it does not do this, it's best to get into the habit of switching this manually to avoid the loud echo."

Just the time of not needing to take notes is wonderful. Now I just print them out and highlight the important stuff. GoToMeetings has made my business look larger than it is when I speak with very large companies. When I set up a GoToMeeting with them they are very impressed. It also gives me the opportunity to demonstrate our products. It's so much better than having them go to YouTube to watch a video. At GoToMeeting I demonstrate and then they can ask questions there ""real time."" If they want me to change a parameter, I can do that, right then, ""real time."" So my experience over all is wonderful.","The people at GoToMeeting have made putting a meeting together simple and easy. I have used their product since it came out on the market. There are Individual mode where the video is on one person and everyone else is watching or you can place it in a group mode where you can see the faces of others in the meeting. No need to take notes GoToMeeting will record your meeting and transcribe it for you, then if you have items that were shown in a prsentation to them you can go back and make links they can go to. Meetings can be only one person speaking or it can be interactive with the presenter controlling who speaks when. The people at GoToMeeting are always one step ahead and the communication market evolves. You can watch, listen and speak through your computer or you can still call into an 800 number. I can't say enough about how easy it is to use the software, it only took me about an hour to review the features and felt comfortable that I could operate the software. They are a;ways coming up with new features.","Cons? What cons? I have to say I know nothing that would be a limiting factor except maybe the number of people you can view, but how many people can you really view on one screen. No honestly I would reccomend this to a business of two people that are in different locations to communicate back and forth as it records your meeting and transcribes it. So, no I have no con's"

It is the company wide go to software for all and it does make connecting with virtual teams much simpler. I think there is something for everyone in this software and it will only get better with time.,"This software is extremely helpful when you are working with a team that is either located in different states domestically or different countries internationally. It is an online platform and browser based so pretty much very very easy to get started. Just setup a account, open browser, go to their website and log in. The software has made useful features but the ones that I have used and like the most are,
- Setup Recurring meetings (so I don't have to go back and do it over and over again)
- Switch between presenters (you can give authority to other participants and let them share their screen)
- Give authority for keyboard and mouse (they can control your screen from their end which at times has been life saver for me)
- Very easy to user user interface (All options are right there on the goto window and it can be either maximized or minimized)
- Says who is speaking (When you hear a voice you can see on the bottom of the screen who is speaking at the moment)
- Can have lot of participants ( I scratch the surface for number of attendees I can have during the meeting.)
- Webcam option (Yes you can choose to enable disable webcam so others can see you)
- Chat option (if you can't hear someone type a message on chat and see if they respond back)
- Record (I haven't used this feature but i bet it would come handy when you do a massive presentation and not everyone can attend but you want them to see what they missed)","I have had many issues with this software. Some few times I have ran into these situations
- I cannot hear the other person though I see them online
- If I start meeting before the scheduled time it acts weird"
17 Go_To_Meeting,Go_To_Meeting,Bonnie M.,educator,Istruzione superiore,Più di 2 anni,5 /5,5 /5,4 /5,5 /5,5 /5,10/10,I LOVE GTM!! (GoToMeeting),19/9/2018,"I love GoToMeeting (GTM)! I teach online and hold live chats sometimes 3 nights a week. I have to sometimes use another program, and at times when it doesnâ€™t work I have quickly jusmped on GTM and it â€˜saves the dayâ€ every time! I love the new TRANSCRIPTION feature too! And so do my students. Granted it isnâ€™t perfect, but what speech-to-text feature is? I make sure to use GTM and introduce it to my students at least once per course. The following week I will switch back to the other program, and then I let my students vote on which program theyâ€™d prefer to use the following week â€“ GTM wins every time! I have used other online VOI chat tools, but they seem to keep changing?! They ""think"" they're making improvements, but take away such a valuable feature as being able to share the moderator's entire screen?! Why?! Either that or their newer version cannot â€œhandleâ€ sharing the entire screen and errors out showing the same screen over and over again in a trail of overlapping screens that run off into infinity. GTM is just easier to use! Inviting attendees is even easy â€“ just set up a future meeting and the email invitation is created for you! Easy peasy! I just took a another look at it again and played around with resizing and moving the feature windows and I even found something else about it that I didn't know before...so now I love it even more!","Being able to quickly and easily show my online students what I am doing, by sharing my entire screen/desktop, on my computer is so important! SHARING MY ENTIRE SCREEN regardless of which program I am using, or switching to, and to also have them see the pop-up or embedded windows (like scroll over Alt tags or edit menus & windows) is a must! Another program (that I will not name) recently changed that specific feature so if the moderator shares the entire screen an infinite trail of windows appears and no one can see a thing. I'll choose go to meeting every time if I have the choice between the two! Don't get me wrong - GTM does allow you to also share only one specific application/program at a time IF that is what you would prefer to do. I just need/prefer to share my entire screen.","Honestly, the only thing I can think of is I wish GTM would allow the attendees to ""raise their hands"" to let me know they have questions, or that I have missed a text/typed question. Either that or just give them an icon that can be clicked on that rings a bells in my ear so that I know to pause and/or ask the viewers to type their question again. I can understand that some moderators might not want to allow such interruptions during a presentation, or during a specific time, but giving the moderator an ON/OFF option for it would work for everyone! The little icon/button could be placed right next to the MIC controls on the Attendees pane."

I also love the companion product GoToWebinar that I've used for many webinars over the last several years. GoToMeeting has gained such good adoption that it has integrations everywhere with tools like Google Calendar, Chrome, Zapier, and others. We used GoToMeeting for years for internal meetings, sales calls--basically any meeting with remote participants. I've even used it to pull church members into my Sunday School class on weekends that are homebound because of illness. I like how you can create a persistent link that you can go to every time rather than having to set up a new link for every meeting. Just be careful if you're having back to back meetings with the same link--otherwise, you get the next audience showing up at the tail end of the current meeting. I solved that by creating two persistent links and alternating them when I have back to back meetings.",It takes more bandwidth than competitors like Zoom.us for similar functionality. Chat is limited to chatting within the meeting rather than creating chat rooms inside your company for teams to collaborate on then hop on a remote meeting. It's meant to be used every time you want to meet rather than an ongoing collaboration tool all of the time. I think they could learn something from Zoom about this.,"Honestly, the only thing I can think of is I wish GTM would allow the attendees to ""raise their hands"" to let me know they have questions, or that I have missed a text/typed question.

I appreciate how fast and smooth the program is and how easy it is to teach my staffs how to create and join meetings. People are able to type in the chat during the meeting if they are too shy to speak, or people can just join the convo whenever. I like how it also shows you which microphone belongs to which users when they are speaking so I know who is speaking. I also like how you can share your screen, which is the most important meet of the meeting for me in order to present my slides for training and promos.","I was hoping there would be a function where I can send reminders out an hour or two before the meeting just so my staff don't forget about the meeting. I know this is the staff's responsibilities, but having a push function could be handy, too."

It has got great customer support too with great privacy and even cost efficient. Best in business, delivers what it promises.","It's the best tool when it comes for video conference with team or other parties. It can be used for professional use or your personal use as well. It is very beneficial in terms of its cost when compared with other products in market.
It enables communication between multiple participants at real time through audio or video conference. The best thing i like is, no matter where i am, i can solve any kind of issues arrises with my team or in company with very easy be it on desktop or through mobile.
Talking about the privacy, it has got best encryption system and has got a better security to your messages.
Knowledge transition sessions can be conducted with large number of group very easily, even if the employee is working remotely and unable to travel. It reduces your effort and travel cost at the same time.","GoToMeeting has got many advantages and i have no dislikes as such with the tool. But one thing really irritates that is if many people talks in the meeting at the same time, there are issues with the audio but gain there is option provided to mute whom you don't want to hear or enable to talk.

Support for the product is great. Every issue we had was answered within minutes of our call. The pricing is adequate considering how many participants you can have on each meeting. Overall, I recommend GoToMeeting as gold standard right up there with WebEx and JoinMe. GoToMeeting is in my opinion more reliable and has easier setup.","GoToMeeting is a staple service at my organization. We used Google Hangouts for simple video and screen sharing sessions, but GoToMeeting presents a more full-featured and polished product. This is essential for things like Board or executive level meetings where interactive white boards and the ability to shift who the presenter is are essential. GoToMeeting has native apps for Mac, PC, Android, and iOS. This is crucial for BYOD organizations or organizations that rely on volunteers. Features like whiteboard make it very easy to share and visualize ideas as they evolve. Having the ability to change who the presenter is and giving that person ""remote control"" of the meeting is also hassle free.","The look and feel of the service is not the same across all platforms. This makes it difficult to explain functionality to users when starting a meeting or if you need to give instructions on the fly. If you are on a Mac and the other person is on a PC and you are trying to remember how to hand off controls and can't remember how on the other platform, this is a real impediment to getting things done."

This makes my job very easy. And I have suggested this software to many of ny clients they also seems to be liking this tool. Honestly I am very satisfied on its features.
I would highly recommend this to everyone who does international business.","Gotomeeting is a great tool for having online conferences and classes. I started using this software less than a year but within this short period of time I am quiet impressed by its uninterrupted video call services. Even I use this software to have one and one client discussions too. It has a facility to share the screen so that I can show the progress of the project to the client easily. It doesn't requires much technical knowledge and support. And the user interface is also pretty awesome. I have never done a massive conference so far. My maximum number of participants will be 10-15 people within this range this software functions pretty well. Unlike other video calling softwares here we dont need to create an invite link all the time, we can use the same link to get in over and over again. And also the video resolution and audio clarity is very good. For the future reference you can record the meetings as well.",According to me there is no cons regarding this software. I hope to see many exciting features to come up in the future.

We wanted a solution which gives us and our clients a familiar feature set along with easy to use controls so we don't need to worry about spending parts of meetings waiting for people to install complex software just to join a simple meeting.,"Being one of the biggest names in collaboration software, GoToMeeting's biggest advantage is that so many people are familiar with it, you don't have to worry much about encountering someone that doesn't know how to join or call into a meeting. There are some great features they have in the product that don't exist in any other platform, like sharing your entire mobile device's screen with a meeting in order to demonstrate a mobile app. On the off-chance you have a meeting with someone who has never used GoToMeeting before, the set up is simple and can usually be done in an unobtrusive way that doesn't run afoul with IT groups.","I don't like the pricing model. It's an extremely robust product, but more often I find myself leveraging similar, albeit much more simple, functionality built into other tools to get much of the same result for internal meetings. For example, if I need to call a snap meeting with my team, rather than ask everyone to join my GoToMeeting, I simply start a call within our (paid) Slack channel and we don't need to worry about tying up the account for anyone else who might need to use it. For setting up a conference line, there are other more affordable solutions (sometimes free ones if you don't mind stability issues) on the marker which can accomplish this goal."

You can have an audience size up to 250 people at a time listening to your webinar. It has remote capabilities so you can record, or lecture anytime anywhere. I like the idea you can log in and setup different webinars for different occasions. Also, there is a feature that allows you to share your screen so others can see what you are doing on your laptop or desktop computer. Secondly, it has a web cam or video camera feature, that allows others to view your presentation. Also, the audio function is easy to use as well. The audio works will with a MIC or PC speakers. Overall, I like the idea of the goto meeting because you can share a public web url to your audience. The user just needs to click the web url that you provide them and they will be joined into your meeting.","Sometimes, if my internet provider is having latency problems, the goto meeting may experience bandwidth issues, due to increase of or influx of traffic.

Meetings sometimes get delayed due to someone having an audio or other connection issue but not often enough for it to be a big problem. One of the most valuable uses is for remote presentations. We hold conferences and judging events where the presenter is unable to be there in person so using GoToMeeting, they are able to present their PowerPoints and interact with the audience in real time almost as seamlessly as if they were there. My biggest recommendation is to always test important meetings and presentations where time and presentation are important factors with the actual connections and computers that will be used at the time of the actual meeting.","It is very easy to schedule meetings, alert participants and add meetings to your calendar. Once meetings are started, there is a useful tool that helps you make sure your audio and video connections are working properly. It is great that there is an option for using computer audio or calling in over the phone. Almost everyone in the business world if familiar with using this software and it seems to have compatibility across the board with all the computers I've used. The ability to allow any participant to become the presenter and share their screen is extremely valuable.","Sometimes, even with the audio/video tool, I've run into issues that take a while to figure out. There might be a setting to turn it off but when you have back to back meetings, one meeting could be interrupted with a loud alert for the next one. Obviously, as an internet based tool, it is only as good as your connection so audio and video quality could suffer significantly with slower connections."

I was able to easily access that link again if I needed to remind participants of how to access the meeting. During the implementation of the meeting, participants receive an intro tutorial on how to setup their audio, etc. As I was aware of the information they were receiving, I would often type in the chat box and reiterate verbally what they would need to do to access their own speaker and more. It is valuable to be able to record the session via GoToMeeting and send that file to participants as a follow-up.","It is good to be mindful that your computer's updates can conflict with GoToMeeting's function. When my computer conducted certain updates, the volume on GoToMeeting would work for a minute or two during the beginning of the session and then it would stop working. So, if you incur an issue with GoToMeeting, keep in mind it could be something external to the actual software. It also takes a sequence of steps to be able to show attendees a recording during your session--the audio settings must be changed to allow for audio to be heard from the recording rather from your microphone.","There's been a couple issues where my customers haven't been able to log into the GoToMeeting link and that's been a challenge.

Gotomeeting allows me to do this very well. And, as I mentioned, it allows me to see their screen and/or their video camera while we are on the Gotomeeting. This allows for immediate problem solving and clarification of issues.","What I like best is that on the Gotomeeting dashboard I can see exactly what the other people see, so I know if my screen is not refreshing or if, when I use two screens, I'm accidently sharing the wrong screen.",I dislike that Gotomeeting looks differently on Explorer than it does on Chrome.

It is an extremely beneficial and easy to use tool for communication. I have been using this tool for almost 2.5 years now to communicate with my vendors and clients. It creates a seamless platform for presentation to the team who is situated offshore.","Being a virtual conference/meeting software, it's imperative that the audio and video option is fluent. Sometimes, there are audio issues when the number of presenters are more.

GoToMeeting not only simplified video conferencing, it enhanced it. This was particularly true for presentations, which were often clunky because I would need to email the powerpoint file separately from the video conference call- so this centralized the whole process as a one-stop shop.","GoToMeeting is a great program in a professional setting for a number of reasons. For starters, video conferences are easy to create and organize with shareable links that can be added to calendars (with reminders) at the click of a button. Then factor in that GoToMeeting is accessible with PCs, tablets and smartphones, and it makes organizing meetings so easy that it becomes a go-to program. Finally, creating and delivering presentations with the program is so easy and good that I end up inventing reasons to use the program for every meeting- and turning as many meetings as I can into video conferences.","Aside for the occasional lapses in audio quality, lag times and glitches, the chat function is not as easy to use as it should be.

Some were good, but were replaced by more popular or up to date programs. GoToMeeting, for me, has been my favorite virtual meeting tool to use. I love being able to set up all the online meetings/chats I will need for the whole month in advance and that GoToMeeting will auto generate the email invitation message with the needed hyperlinks and access codes so I can easily send out to all of my attendees/students well in advance or just a few minutes before if needed. And the transcription feature is something I especially like as do my students, so they can search through it for needed information.","GoToMeeting is by far one of the easiest to use online virtual meeting/chat platforms I have used. Iâ€™ll use it even when the institution Iâ€™m teaching for in any given month will provide another program/platform to use for online class live chat sessions, because I know I wonâ€™t I wonâ€™t have any problems using it AND my attendees/students will be able to login to the live session without needing a long tutorial on how to use it (this last one is a BIG plus). And with their recent upgrades itâ€™s my GoTo for live chats.","The recent upgrades to GoToMeeting are really nice, but I am disappointed that they did not include the much needed feature that will the attendees (non-moderator users) â€œraise your handâ€ to get the moderatorâ€™s attention during a live session. Still, it is a very good live chat/meeting platform and I will continue to use it over other programs when I have the choice to pick my own program."

Much Easier to use than other competing products such as WebEx. It is always great when the meetings software is not causing problems during your meeting!","Would like some aditional options and features that some of the other meetings products have, such as Polling and Webinar."

We love the quality of service at the time of customer service. It really is a very good software that I recommend to everyone.","First of all, it should be noted that GoToMeeting is an excellent Software and one of the things I like most is that the service makes it easy for us to set up webinars for audiences from all over the world. From anywhere, what makes meeting with Long distance people, and very fast and easy. I love it because it is a great tool when it comes to video conferencing with the team everywhere. It allows us to use it in a professional or personal way. It is really very satisfying to be software since it has made our daily routine much easier, I am fascinated.",GoToMeeting IS a Great Software with which I am Satisfied. But if there is something I would like to have a function where I could send reminders three or two hours before a meeting so that no person on the team forgets a meeting. And this is a small price to pay. Since it is a software this is only a small detail which I would like you to add. But I am satisfied with this software and I hope it continues to improve day by day

It did what it was advertised to do...enabled Remote Desktop Support services for clientele. But then, by trying to be ""all things"" to all deployments...it got, well, convoluted. Much more cumbersome than what was originally intended for. Too many Options, not enough features. Very cumbersome to do Deployments after that.","Initially, it was *FREE*!!! And then, after a number of YEARS of using the software, they dictated a Subscription Service, which was EXHORBITANT and terrible! And, their Support started to suffer.","Cost, and the fact that we were *deceptively* lured in, by their Marketing Dept.!!!"

The one thing that I really like about it is that it provide the best services for the audio and the video conferences for the business meeting and this type of video quality does not provide any of its competitors. With the help of GoToMeeting software, we can easily communicate with anyone.","GoToMeeting is the best software for the communication. We are able to communicate with the audio and video conferences to anyone such as friends and colleagues. This software has outstanding features like messages, audio and the video conferences and recording and all these features are very important for the business meeting. Its chat options are so great. Hence, you can chat in a group video calls and conferences at anyone and at anytime.",There are some problems in the GoToMeeting software such as it does not provide the great quality of voice in the audio and video calls and conferences. Sometimes we can share the screen with our team members in the business meeting. But I really must say that it is not much expensive and that's why all the small business companies easily afford this efficient software which we can be used for the video conferences.
53 Go_To_Meeting,Go_To_Meeting,Utente Verificato,Operations,Ordine pubblico,Più di 1 anno,5 /5,5 /5,4 /5,5 /5,5 /5,10/10,I love GoToMeeting,25/10/2018,"GoToMeeting has helped my team and I connect with clients and leads in all stages without having to leave our office space. The ease of use gives us the opportunity to have back to back meetings since all you have to do is click on ""start"" and in a second you are at your next meeting.",I love GoToMeeting. It's easy to understand and you can get the hang of it on your first go. The whole system is self explanatory and you don't need to go through a manual to learn how to use the basics. It can generate a new link for every conference call that you schedule so that no two meetings collide - imagine your 3:00 pm getting into the conference call 10 minutes early only to then walk in on your 2:00 pm meeting that hasn't finished yet.,There's really not a negative thing I would say about GoToMeeting. The only issue I would have is the bill. My team and I use this for business meetings so paying the yearly plan is no problem with us since it helps us gain money. But if you need something free and don't mind not having quality features then this is not for you as they only give you a free 14 day trial and then you'll have to pay to continue with it. I wouldn't use this if I ran a non-profit organization.

Overall GTM is a great asset to our company and we do not plan to explore other options. Call quality is reliable and that is the most important thing we can ask for.,"GTM has improved our inter-office communication vastly. Having a team spread across 4 states and 2 countries it is imperative that we have a reliable meeting tool. We liked it so much that we began using it with our SaaS subscribers for support and sales, as well. The interface is easy enough to use and for less tech savy users, we can register them for meetings and send them a single link to click that will automatically downlaod the meeting agent and allow them to initiate a call. We especially like being able to share screen/mouse control to help work through any support issues.","There is no ability to lock individual meetings. If we are scheduled back to back, and we are not using one of our unique meetings (which sometimes has to be the case) then there is a risk that someone hops into the meeting early and interferes with our current call. Also, the tool is slightly expensive for what you get."

It always meets our needs and allows us to accomplish our goals pertaining to the shared documentation in a meeting.","I like how easy Go To Meeting is to use in regards to setting up the webinars and while conducting a webinar. I like that I am able to see who has joined the call, as well as what I'm displaying on the screen to the audience. I also love that I'm able to pause the display and freeze the screen, allowing me to look at something in the background without interrupting the flow of the meeting.","We occasionally have technical issues when using GoToMeeting, which usually pertains to an attendee not being able to launch the webinar portion or see the shared screen. Often, it only takes closing the browser and relaunching it, so it isn't a huge impact, but it would be nice to not encounter these glitches."

I like its video and audio quality the most because sometimes I feel that I am not virtually talking to someone, it feels like face to face meeting and this the best thing that I like about it.",There is one thing that I like least about it and that is sometime GoToMeeting stops working when the internet gets slow but overall I am very happy with this product.

Very efficient and user friendly!","I like the tools it has and its functionalities, for example: how you can see the audience and even see the ones who are not paying attention, it helps you change the rythm or the content of your presentation to capture your audience's attention back. I also like the fact that you can change presenter, share screen, stat video, mute or aun-mute the audience, raise hand.. there's a lot you can play with and it's very user friendly so it makes the presentation go smooth and adapt the features to whatever kind of remote conference you need to have.","Nothing really, I enjoyed very much working with this tool, very stable connection and audio reception and transmission."

Especially for these reasons, it's indeed perfect. Conferences may also be interrupted someone has a video or some such other poor communication. Amongst the most essential technologies is virtual demonstrations. We organize workshops and analyze activities where even the speaker can't go to online meetings in reality.GoTo Meeting is a big bonus. Simplicity of use. It's also very simple and helpful to connect to my outlook email software application.","I believe that if the price dropped a bit, particularly for smaller businesses, you will expand your market share. Many times to a top management, I had to justify our budget. It is essential that the sound and visual meets the same time to other participants in the meeting but Perhaps the amount of presenters is more likely to cause audio difficulties. The customer service people really isn't very speed at solving issues and often the other participant does not know the difficulties and delays a call."

Then simply put in my honest opinion they got greedy like their competitor join.me and charge for Anything shared = Bad business model. In hypothetical purposes I wouldn't have cared to paid FULL price if I had to 1) constantly use it. 2) had more than 2 people sharing the screen such as a big meeting with more than 2 .,"1) At the time it was an amazing free to use as a individual screen share software and presentation software.
2) It was very easy to use.
3) The integration and ease of use was browser based and and pretty simple.",I HATE the new pay to use system. It was important they kept the business model they originally had. They matched their competitor and therefore ruined an amazing screen share software business model. They need to revert to the older model individual i.e. free individual and more than 3 on at the same time needed to pay. Which is very reasonable.

Our entire organization (sales, marketing, success, and support) all have licenses for scheduling screen shares and web conferences with leads and customers. You can share your screen, allow another person to share their screen, and even take control of another user's screen for troubleshooting issues, or training purposes. It is easy to use for those setting up and those connecting to a web conference. It has a number of wonderful integrations - the most useful being the Google Calendar plug in - which enables you to easily schedule GoToMeetings directly from a calendar event. You can also record sessions for replay later (helpful for training or demos).",It would be great if their recordings of screenshares were more compressed so that longer presentations weren't so large or the ability to integrate with a cloud based storage site to allow default a recording to go directly to an online location for sharing and playback.,I HATE the new pay to use system.

It allows you to join a meeting from both the browser or if you want you can download the app on your desktop. Screen sharing and joining from mobile for only audio are also very useful features in this application.,"Sometimes the application hangs and it takes lot of time when someone is trying to do a screen share. Sometimes the whole application freezes when some other heavy application is running on the system. Also, the user sometimes gets confused about the mute and un-mute button toggle as the color code for the button is not easily understandable."

That little work became great in our internal space so that we could better direct our clients and contacts with greater confidence.

The best part that we have found is the final, since after having done the thorough work, we only have to wait for the results. The one that seems most important to us at the close of a campaign is that SendinBlue allows the output of a real report on email data. This is a final resource that is very useful for subsequent analyzes that can be applied in successive campaigns.","Our Organize and SendinBlue bets a lot on transactional email, but when we use it it reduces the performance of SendinBlue. This was something we didn't really have, so hopefully it will be improved.

If you are a presenter, it is possible to control the audio and the control of the participants, which makes the meeting easier to carry.

I like that I can use it on iOS and it works very well.","It is a complicated program to use for meetings with people who had not used it before. I noticed that when I use my Windows computer and the meeting there are Mac computers, the software is different, this creates confusion when we should give some assistance to someone who does not know it. The screen sharing controls are confusing. Audio and microphone are also confusing. The chat, I think it should improve. They should consider including a ""blackboard"" in the paid version. The program usually does not work the first time, but the last software downloads and this can be annoying when you need to join a meeting quickly. I have noticed that there is an error in the time zone, even though I put it correctly the system chooses another, it is confusing."

That is to say that it basically became less popular, with many companies (ours included) switching over to Zoom. From what I understand, the reason that we switched was a cost savings / feature set upgrade decision. So what we liked least was the cost for the feature set we were receiving.

The screen sharing option is helpful (something not available through most free conference call services), and the platform is easy to use and fairly intuitive (no training is necessary).","The two cons of GoToMeeting are 1) It's not free. There are a lot of free conference call services online, and while they offer a smaller range of services (i.e. generally no screen sharing, etc), if you just need a basic set up for conference calling, purchasing a GoToMeeting subscription is not necessary. 2) The screen sharing aspect of GoToMeeting can be glitchy.

Our team is able to align with other departments such as finance and logistics as well. The phone application really helps and one may just call the toll-free number to access the meeting audio and video. I believe it is worth the investment for large enterprises to invest in the Pro version and avail the added benefits.","GoToMeeting is a simple software with built-in capabilities of web and video conferencing at the touch of a button. I consider it to be simple yet powerful when it comes to functionality. It is easy to join a meeting, which can be either using a toll-free number for your country or clicking on the tailor-made link or URL to the meeting. It is as simple as that! I am able to access meetings through my laptop, smartphone and tablet.
The video quality is better than competitive software in the market, and it is possible to share your screen for better team coordination, for example. I also recommend the customer support offered, with several levels of support available: live training, chat and online videos.","So far I have no major issues with GoToMeeting, as I am able to attend virtual meetings, coordinate with my virtual teams for all procurement purposes seamlessly. One aspect that could be improved is pricing can be made more competitive as compared to similar video conferencing software."

If you need to play a video or song for the meeting, participants wonâ€™t be able to hear it.

It is compatible to any OS and is a really good alternative for Skype, hangouts. Nowadays, globalization is taking a toll over all the organizations. This calls in for a need for such video conferencing software. This works wonders while connecting to clients sitting in various parts of the world.

Once I setup the meeting, it instantly opens a meeting request via outlook for me to email out to the parties involved. It's extremely quick and effective way to get a meeting setup quickly and helps me not procrastinate on getting meetings booked. It also has built in features to record meetings for later review, which is extremely helpful.","You can only have (1) meeting per account at a time, I'm unsure if this is just my companies plan with them, or if it's a limitation forever.

And for the price, has better audio / video quality than we've found elsewhere.","Hard to determine when it will happen, but sometimes audio will cut out, or clients will lose video. Likely a local Internet connection, but frustrating that it can't tell you that. Also, the new meeting recording in the cloud works pretty well EXCEPT for their transcriptions. It has a Botnik approach to AI. It doesn't know who is speaking, and gets about 80% of the words / context correct.

And the ability to create pre-recorded webinars is also fantastic because it gives us the opportunity to invite guests to host webinars that normally we wouldn't be able to provide due to time constraints, scheduling conflicts, etc.","One of the cons is that I wish it were easier to make pre-recorded webinars. It would be absolutely amazing to be able to just upload a recording and use that for a pre-recorded webinar rather than having to schedule and perform a webinar to record. Also (and I don't believe this is Go to Meeting's fault) but there are barely any third party marketing softwares that fully integrate with the pre-recorded capabilities.

It makes working remote feel like you're as connected as you would be in the office.","I've used GoToMeeting for years, and I have to say, it's probably the best conference software I've used. It allows for connecting virtually any way possible - people can connect via a meeting link through a browser, natively on the app on your smartphone or tablet, or simply dial in like a conference call. Screen sharing is incredibly simple and allows for easy collaboration, and quality of calls has consistently been above board. If you suddenly find yourself in a remote work scenario, I can't recommend using GoToMeeting enough.","There's a slight learning curve. Especially if you're getting set up as a presenter or administrator. In my time with GoToMeeting, I've had to present probable two or three times and it was only by the last time that I felt truly comfortable with it.

At times I want to maintain confidentiality by not sharing my desk or cell phone number with all people. This has been possible.,It is easy to use and very intuitive. It is compatible with most browsers and devices. It is easy to create a meeting and share it with participants. It is also easy to sync the tool with your calendar.,"There is nothing that I do not like about this software. It is a very useful tool that has helped me conduct meetings smoothly. The only thing is that can be improved is that too much dial up information is shared with users. Depending on the location, the users need to dial into a number, I think this feature can be improved."

The calls are always high quality as well as the video. It is nice to see the faces of coworkers that work at other locations. We have used GoToMeeting for over 10 years, and it has never caused us any issues!",There was a time when I believe we needed to see more people on camera and it was limited.

It has benefited us by allowing a seamless way for attendees to access the call, they receive a small tutorial when setting up so we don't have to do it for them, and it has saved us time that we don't have to set up in-person meetings as we can do face to face with the ability to screen-share. Clients love it because they don't have to come down to my office and can do it from the comfort of their own home.","This is a great software and I like most that you can do audio, video and screen sharing. I used GoToMeeting at several jobs, and the most recent job I used it in was working as a sales manager, sharing my screen for my clients to see overviews of what their venue would look like and different design boards. I also like that you can add several users seamlessly and that they get an email sent with easy instructions on how to access the call. I also like the chatbox ability for them to type in a question while I'm presenting and I can get to it when I am done rather than interrupting my train of thought.","My only complaint with GoToMeeting is the connectivity issues that it has. I probably experienced connectivity issues 50% of the time while using it, but it is easily fixed by hanging up and calling back. It's just a pain and looks unprofessional when you have to tell your client or boss to hang up and try back. It would be a lot more seamless without the issues but it honestly isn't a huge problem to where I would stop using it. The pros outweigh this con."

All in all, a very solid tool!","The best part of GoToMeeting was the ease of integrating Outlook and GoToMeeting so that my users could make their meetings more easy to manage from a centralized location. The fact that it also auto-populated also helped administrate what was going on behind the curtains. Cloud recording was also a nice touch, making it help save space on my users' machines.","The only issue I ran into was ease of changing licensing. For a growing organization such as ourselves, this may not be the easiest tool to grow on the go, but for established organizations without much turnover, this is made easier by their licensing model."

There is no confusion and we don't need to check whether they have skype of other means of connecting, with gotomeeting anyone can use it easily from all devices.","Setting up a conference call, meeting or webinar is easy and attendees join without any issues. There are less dropouts than previous solutions. It's great that we can share screens and change presenters if an attendee also wants to share their screen. It is great how it allows me to choose a timezone so that I can always be sure to get the time correct when inviting international users.","Sometimes it can take a while for the attendees audio to connect, but it's usually only a matter of a couple of minutes. It would also be useful if they had more countries with local teleconference avaialable."

I have taught webinars and find that this platform offers the easiest learning curve for new users and can maintain a great lecture with notes moving without interruption while allowing people to present questions in real time that can either be answered by a third person via type or seen and answered by the presenter during the lecture. There just isn't another software program for me as a user, both as a presenter and as a professional interacting with my national employer during training events.","This software gives people a much smoother initial connection and the meeting is held with greater clarity and far better interaction than competing products. Once comfortable with the software, there is nothing like this and it worth everything invested to have a professional, quiet meeting event instead of open video platforms.",There is a minor learning curve for users and it can sometimes make it difficult for getting a meeting started on time for everyone involved. I think the solution is simple and that is to have a mock intro and test to make sure everyone knows the interface prior to the first test. The company suggests this and offers a way to do it but few users seem to take advantage of it.

It did that well and we didn't have any issues on that side of things. Has all the basic features (screen share, good video/audio, chat, recordings, etc) you need to do online demos well.","It came up short when it came to doing webinars and it was a bit tricky to manage larger audiences, but to be completely honest it could've been us not being educated well enough on the product as well. The price was also on the higher end of things."

GoToMeeting has allowed our Family Counselors to assist these clients in a more personal way. Some of our family counselors are older and have struggled with learning new software and online tools, but GoTo Meeting offers a user friendly interface and an intuitive user experience that has been extremely easy for all of them to learn and utilize.","Honestly, we have not had any issues with this software.

So for the past year i am using the GoToMeeting software for my conference calls which may have attendees across the globe. Its a bit complex but its powerfull. It gives us plenty of options and now i am using it regularly.,Its very much good for conference calls when compared to other softwares used for conference calls. Distance between the people is not an issue here and we use this software for having conference video calls from different countries. Its the best one i have used in recent times.,"The least i like about this software is that the complexity it has when using it for the first time. It takes time to get familarised with this software. The Creator,Presenter roles etc makes it more complex . Also the maximum number of attendents is limited to 11."

GoToMeeting was a great solution for all of our departments! We used it to work together as well as to help our customers. I would recommend GoToMeeting to anyone that wants to meet face to face, without being in the same physical place.","As a growing business, we have loved using GoToMeeting! GoToMeeting is a great solutions for our Account Managers to conduct Account Reviews and even for our Support Team to jump on a web meeting to see the customers exact issue.

Especially when you are traveling, you need to be able to access a meeting tool within minutes. GoToMeeting allows you to setup a meeting from your mobile phone or have a permanent link available that your crew can use whenever you need them to collaborate. The functions within the interface do not need much of an introduction and is intuitive enough to support users that might be used to other tools or none.","GoToMeeting is focused on quick and easy meetings with few participants. I personally worked with up to 12 participants at the same time, even tough a larger set of licenses is possible. The major drawback is the fact that only 6 participants can have their camera on at the same time (2018 version). Similarly, the software gives you few options to influence other users such as permanently muting someone or encouraging file downloads."

For some customers, it can be significant that they sense comfortable with the video conferencing scheme that they're consuming. If you idea on spending another video conferencing software, make sure that there's are no transfers as customers don't feel relaxed with unidentified places.","Since numerous of my customers are big or old school thoughts, GoToMeeting seems to fit top as it has been everywhere for a long period. I use GoToMeeting due to the famous name. It does do well at showing/broadcasting a performance to distant operators and mobile operators. To customers, itâ€™s a reliable term that they sense relaxed with and can effortlessly direct. It's so frequently used, numerous persons are relaxed using any essential transfer or retrieving the place on a business CPU.. We like that you can have a couple of dissimilar video foundations, like attendees, room cameras, and the demonstration.","There are many larger video conferencing software out there that customers just don't use that. It also sometimes requires a download depending on the device used. To clients, it seems that many just do the basics to get the meeting over with.

Despite the aggravating new skin, I would definitely recommend it so someone.","The best feature of GoToMeeting is that it allows collaboration among our team members without having to be in the same place. Now with this outbreak of the Coronavirus, this functionality is going to be more important than ever. It also allows us to conduct meetings with long distance clients with ease.",I do not like the new skin that was recently unveiled in a software update.

It's helpful feature is sharing the screen functionality which usually helps during any reviews or when giving a presentation.","I wouldn't say it as a con as I don't really have one, but a nice to have feature when someone shares screen, if the organizer or someone on the call to have screen access of the one who's currently presenting and other feature would be to support multiple screen sharing ability."

Taking a screen shot has been useful for me while someone else is presenting and I need to save a copy of the document they place on the screen for future reference. I am also a big fan of various functions within their interface like scheduling meeting because as a rule we try to have weekly meetings even though several of the members have other obligations, we can still be reminded and start our sessions on time. GoToMeeting has surely worked for my organisation.",I like Go To Meeting preview setting which allows me to see if my hair needs to be done! But on a serious note there are aspects of this software application that are unique that an average person might take for granted but which I truly appreciate like their view options and the first one that comes to mind is the who's talking options which allows me to focus on the present speaker in the group only instead of everyone. Another useful tool is the camera only view with shows only those member who are actively sharing their camera. I can't say everything I like but just know there is video conferencing and there is GoToMeeting in a category by itself,Just a side point users of the software must be aware that they need a proper internet connection with a moderate speed. any lagging will not be the fault of GoToMeeting

You are able to use your computer's audio and camera to hear and see others, you can share your screen, and you can record the meeting in case someone is missing it or you may need to reference some of the material later on. For companies with consultants or employees not co-located, this is a great way to collaborate with your team.","What I like most about this software is how easy to use it is. It is not only easy to join a meeting (even if you have not downloaded GoToMeeting or used it before) and how easy it is to host a meeting. Anyone can host a meeting, so you do not need a project manager or coordinator to schedule the meetings and wait for them to start the meeting for you. Moreover, you can use audio and camera directly from your computer, creating a great in-person face to face scenario even if people are working remotely. Lastly, your company's directory of employees can be added into GoToMeeting so it is easy to find the people you need to invite to meetings.","What I like least about this software is that you have to wait for the host/ the person who set up the GoToMeeting to be there before you can start. Sometimes this person may be running late or couldn't make it for some reason, and the other attendees cannout use that GoToMeeting to still continue on. They are creating a mobile app in order to help with the on-to-go use and busy lifestyles of people, but they are not quite there yet."

You can either create a custom one time handle or you can send your individual handle that can be used at any time (I found this most helpful when I needed to quickly get a few people on a call without much warning, I could just tell everyone to hop onto my gotomeeting handle, my company used your first and last name for custom handles.) You can also assign multiple hosts to a meeting which is great for if you have a busy schedule and can only make it for part of the meeting or if you get stuck in another meeting and can't make it at all - your other hosts can launch the meeting without you.",The audio can be a pain sometimes. It has an option to dial into a conference line instead of using your computer audio and we always do that option. The computer audio really struggles (even if your computer has a great microphone). I've had a few issues with the meetings freezing up but it could have been an internet issue. The biggest issue is really the audio problems.,"What I like least about this software is that you have to wait for the host/ the person who set up the GoToMeeting to be there before you can start. Sometimes this person may be running late or couldn't make it for some reason, and the other attendees cannout use that GoToMeeting to still continue on. They are creating a mobile app in order to help with the on-to-go use and busy lifestyles of people, but they are not quite there yet."

When we first started using this new software over two years ago, we would have phone meetings using GoToMeeting, the biggest advantage to these meetings was the ability to do a screen share and be able to go through training seasons with the person training us being in Colorado while we are located in California. Being able to work through the process and have our account manager walk us through the process was really valuable. The screen share can be done by either person depending on how the meeting is set up.
During the early stages of setup, it was great to be able to have the ability to use GoToMeeting with our account rep and be able to troubleshoot problems that I had run into.
I have found these feature to be so valuable as I could call for help and my account rep would set up a quick meeting to help me. This really helped me learn the system much quicker than I would have without having someone on site to train us.",It sometimes takes a long time for the meeting to load and get set up. I would suggest always joining a meeting at least 10 - 15 minutes early the first time you use this software. Other than this its a fantastic product.

Surprisingly, it's better than an audio-only call!","We bought GoToMeeting to replace a freemium product we had used before. Now, the quality of the calls is much better. We can use webcams and share the screen while maintaining high quality. This feature is really well integrated: I can see both the screen and my caller in one window. Very convenient!",I wish there was an option to have the window with the camera stay always on top.

GoToMeeting stood up an account for us, and had a support engineer work with me to have everything ready to go within an hour. Fast forward a year later, and I'm advocating that we move off of WebEx entirely and only on to GoToMeeting. Its cheaper, and significantly better in my opinion. Whats not to like about that?","The simplicity of starting an account and getting right to hosting meetings. It is significantly easier than WebEx, and the pricing is a thousand times better. There are of course restrictions on how many can attend your meetings (you'll have to pay more for a higher number of possible attendees), but that is to be expected. Adding authorized users, recording meetings, screen sharing, and taking control are all things that GoToMeeting does better than its competitors, several of which I have to use frequently.","Some of the restrictions on adding Administrators or people able to host meetings are not ideal, as I need to pay more to be able to have more Administrators so they can host their own meetings. I know most meeting software tools do this, but pricing tiers like this is the one complaint I have for GoToMeeting."

The app or program downloaded on my computers have not caused any issues, which is todays world of downloading something is one thing you are sometimes worried about. I use this as someone who sets up meetings and as someone who just calls in and I have never had a bad experience.","I am on the road a lot and this is such an easy product to set up a quick meeting and get the information out without having to open my laptop. I love that I can use the phone to set up meetings, call into a meeting and ensure I don't miss a beat with any meeting. This is also a program that has worked well with my both my Dell Laptop and my Macbook. This is also easy for anyone to log into and you don't have to download anything if you don't want to and just call in. If I have a meeting with 15+ people, most will just call in and they still get what they need.","There truly is nothing at this time that I could say negative about the product. I am not the admin of this system for my company, so I can't speak to the pricing or anything, but as a user alone, it's very easy to use on multiple platforms."

I host several webinars each year, and as a team we host 20+/year, and out of all the events that we do for recruiting, setting up and running our GoToMeeting webinar is the easiest.","I think the best thing about GoToWebinar is that it is incredibly easy to use. Setting up a webinar event takes about 1 minute, it provides a shareable link to promote the event (if using for university recruiting purposes as I am), and then provides analytics after the event has passed (who attended, etc.), which is really important in the recruiting world.",There isn't much that I don't like about this software. The only thing that comes to mind is that there is no way to edit webinar recordings. This isn't major unless there is a component of the webinar recording that you want to remove - like if the record button accidentally is pressed 5 minutes too early and there is 5 minutes of dead air time in the recording. This happened to me and I had to send the raw file to a team member who happened to have some video editing skillsets and was able to do that. I do wish there was the funtionality for basic video editing of the recording.

It is extremely easy to schedule meetings , alert the participants and update your calendar. The feature that enables any participant to become the presenter is extremely helpful. You can also record sessions and play them later. The voice quality is Clear too.",There are hardly any Cons.

The ability to hold conference calls and include audio, visual, video, recording elements, etc. is amazing. They do an overall pretty decent job, but I would like to see some improvements that I haven't seen over the past 2 years of using the software.","The things I like least are that the software is overall less reliable than what I require. I use this for business meetings that are highly critical to my company. I hate having to worry whether my call is going to drop (if the leader drops the call is lost!), if people are going to be able to easily log in, if people are going to feel naturally comfortable navigating, and if my ""CLEAN"" screen is going to remain clean.

One click and you instantly have remote meeting details added to the calendar invite for all attendees. It's better and easier to use than a competitor like Lifesize.,Some environments seem to have difficulty installing the application to the computer.

This software has many great features, such as video sharing, screen sharing. It even records your meetings for you and transcribes it too so that you can refer back to certain points and link specific things to whoever you may need to forward this to afterwards. My favorite feature about GoToMeeting is that the presenter controls who is speaking which is great as these types of meetings can often become quite crowded and noisy. Lastly,",I honestly cannot find a single thing that I do not like about this software. It's amazing and the development team at GoToMeeting are always on the ball adding new features.

It was very easy to set up and the connection is clear. I especially like that I can have my own personal link to send to clients to connect immediately, I can share the screen I choose and give the mouse to anyone else in the meeting. I also use the recording option to record meetings if the whole team was not able to attend a meeting. This was very helpful in order to avoid repeating a presentation over again.","I didn't use GTM to interact with international clients, as it requires a steady internet connection and at times it would freeze. I think that they can have better chat features and the ability to take polls.",I honestly cannot find a single thing that I do not like about this software. It's amazing and the development team at GoToMeeting are always on the ball adding new features.

Great tool which is affordable for consultants and small organizations when you can't spend thousands on more reliable and sophisticated tools.","I would suggest this cloud based tool to anyone who doesn't have more sophisticated and expensive tools such as Adobe Connect. I have used this often, a long time as free tool, for meetings and conference calls. It has all the features and versatility you look for a meeting tool. I like that I can use it with different operating systems without hitch. It also gives me compatibility with office 365. Multinational toll-free numbers help when I am collaborating on projects outside of my home country. Very cheap alternative to a lot of pricy meeting tools!","It looks slightly different on different browsers, which could be an issue sometimes, but you get used to it. I have also noticed that features are changed constantly, which can be frustrating looking for options. Also, often times, with screen share, there is a lag of few seconds, which can be annoying."

Especially between different countries and in meetings that we must share screen.,"I like the stability and its operation, also its internet signal indicators, it is very useful to share screens as well as taking control of a remote screen or a presentation. It is very complete in the access and configuration options of the different audio and video elements. It has a very good quality in its communications, it consumes resources of moderate bandwidth, I like that it does not significantly affect the performance in the workstation.","I do not like that it is not so intuitive for the user, the program requires assistance from systems staff or empowered users. The chat system can be confusing in some situations. In some cases it is difficult for us to take the double screen function. The licensing system seems to me that it should be a little more flexible. The interfaces between different platforms have many differences and this affects the moment of installing the conference, so that the user is easily guided."

Reasonable cost.","Sometimes it is hard to find the icon you want to use; the video component is more difficult to use than the rest of it, which has led to almost no adoption of the video component. Some of this is probably the fault of our users & equipment, & some is due to the app itself. I don't think that this app is any better than, say, WebEx, but for us it was less costly that WebEx for virtually the same functionality."

They make it real simple to host meetings, share screens, give screen control in addition to the usual video and audio. I would recommend this to someone that hosts meetings for less than 200 participants and general meeting needs.","GoToMeeting has a series of functionalities that help participants to interact with each other with sending files and sharing screens which saves the time to send out individual emails to your team members. You can also accommodate upto 200 participants at a time and supports desktops, laptops and cell phones which is a huge plus","There are a few cons i have come across over the years with this software. Since this is a webinar software, you do not really have the option to track the attendance for these meetings and have them exported to you. You also only have the option to send your messages/questions to the whole group on the meeting. It would be nice to have the option to be able to message individuals during such meetings."

It's very easy to use- scheduling a meeting and sending an invite out takes less than a minute, and joining a meeting can be done simply by clicking a link.","It's extremely easy to use as an end user- I can schedule and send out a meeting invite in under a minute, and joining the meeting is as easy as clicking on a link to auto-launch the program.","Occasionally I would run into issues where clients couldn't join my meeting because their company's computer security policies block the program from running, but that's going to happen with any program, and isn't an issue with GoToMeeting itself."

I have used GoToMeeting more in the last two months than in the last three years. As a small business owner it has been a great tool.,I like that my entire team can login for meetings. I found the cost very reasonable. Setup was straight forward. People who have never used GoToMeeting are able to login with ease.,"When I am in the middle of a meeting and want to extend the time, it is difficult to find answers in the Help section.

I have used both the paid and the free versions.,The software is great if you want to move forward with a paid plan. The meeting record feature is huge if you are doing any type of onramping or teaching of any materials.,"The free version of the software is verrryy limiting in it's options. Limited meeting sizes, limited meeting options, and if you want to do any legitimate meetings as a company, you need to upgrade to a paid plan."

I also like the features it has for how you would like to join the meeting specific to audio, for example; you could join the meeting visually on your computer and audibly on your phone - this is useful when your computer doesn't have the best speakers or you want the speaker closer to your mouth.","The best part of GoToMeeting is that is widely known by most people in the business world, so no matter who you are setting up a meeting with - they have usually used the application at least once or twice before so you usually don't have to worry about explaining how to get to the meeting. It's also nice that there is a smart phone app, it makes it a lot easier to take meetings while you are driving or when you don't have access to your computer.","The only troubles I have found with GoToMeeting is that there have been a couple of glitches that I've noticed but they don't happen too often. I also noticed that you can't use GoToMeeting on your mobile device without downloading the app, or in other words you can't get to it from Safari, Chrome, etc. - if you try to go to the website it will just take you to the app store to download the app instead. This made me late for a meeting once when I was trying to hop on quickly from my phone."

I schedule conference calls. I use it to troubleshoot our online product. I use it for trainings. I use it to go over reports.,"I like how easy to use. I can set up a Go-To-Meeting in minutes so I can show clients a report, spreadsheet, etc or just to have a conference call without sharing my screen. Often I do trainings and I love the fact that I can record the training so it can be posted for new hire on-boarding.","The only think I can say negative, is, frequently I would lose the ability to schedule direct from my outlook email. I would have to reinstall to my outlook and then at some point I couldnâ€™t install. Still setting up meetings were very easy without it."

I use GTM to work with colleagues as well as customers. I'm able to share either camera, screen or both. Recordings are easy to create and save.",Controls are simple and logical. It's easy to create meetings and sync with my Outlook calendar. Recording is easy. The sound and video quality is high. I've seen alerts of downtime but experienced very little. I did have a minor issue which the GTM support team was able to troubleshoot and fix.,"When I record a meeting, it takes a long time (often over an hour) to convert the recording.
Customers who use a desktop computer without a microphone often struggle to figure out using the phone to get audio during the call."

When you just talk over the phone you can only do so much. So I recommend using this overall, but it still it still is difficult for new users and you need a very strong internet connection. If your office does not have a great connection you will have issues. I think it's best to keep the link to GTM in some type of shared calendar, because keeping track of all of those links can be very confusing and people will end up in an empty video conference just sitting around waiting confused.","I like that I can access it on my phone when the internet is poor at my office/ at home. I also like that you can share a screen to show a presentation and have everyone follow along. I find it easy to use, but many older coworkers do have issues with it and need constant help.",It constantly goes in and out and drops people. I work with older people who have trouble figuring it out and will have issues with turing the mute off and on. It also can be difficult to switch between presenters and to get the audio working when using projectors. When people sign in it also can make a ping sound which is a little annoying. You need to have a steady internet connection for it to be worthwhile.

We usually share screens while talking, and rarely use video functionality. It is a highly reliable service, in my experience.",GoToMeeting is very reliable and is well-designed enough that even people who haven't used this kind of software have fairly minimal difficulties with it. I appreciate the ability to use a phone line of choice for a call or to use the one GoToMeeting supplies. Sharing screens is also easier on GoToMeeting than about any other collaboration software I have used.,"The biggest problem I have with GoToMeeting is that if we let meeting participants choose phone or VOIP, they often use both and it creates deadly feedback. The other problem is that I cannot restrict some users to listen-only mode or mute them definitively from the control panel. That means that people with awful background noise can be muted administratively and then simply unmute themselves to keep on disrupting the call. Customer service has not been able to suggest a solution for this."

We mainly utilize it for screen sharing and recording. GTM offers the simplest screen recording option out of all that we tried.,This product is widely used and because of that many people already know how to use it.

I've used a few others in the past and they didn't work all so great. Zoom is good if you want to just play around with friends. But if you are serious about your business and work. There is no other substitute! Go with GoToMeeting.,Our company has been using GoToMeeting for over 10 years. It's by far the better choice I've found out. My boss recently was told to use Zoom. We used it a few weeks and the team was so frustrated with the low quality sound and visuals that we switched back to GoToMeeting. Zoom is free (at least the version my boss was using) and the old saying is. You get what you pay for. GoToMeeting by far is the best we've used.,"The thing I least like about GoToMeeting is that I wish there was a good way to archive each meeting. I'm not the admin of the software. I'm pretty sure you can do a ""Publish"" feature. I just wish there was an private archive feature. But no other video conference software does that either. So it isn't that big of a complaint."

Being able to make others presenters is very helpful, as well as being able to have mouse control. This makes calls with prospects super easy since they can play their screens and we can just ask for mouse control and fix very easily what is wrong. A must-have tool for companies who are always jumping on calls, doing demos, and especially for technology companies. Also, being able to connect my google calendar with a GoToMeeting extension is a huge time saver when it comes to sending calendar invites.",Can't think of anything!

There may even be a trial period where you can take it for a test run before purchasing it.",I like that I can invite clients to meet online to go over documents and project info. I like how it is easy for clients to set up on their end. I'm able to grant what permissions the client(s) will have once they enter the virtual meeting as well. This also makes GoToMeeting great for small scale online seminars and product demonstrations. I'm able to share my screen or live video from my camera. Saves time and money compared to in-person events.,"There is not much I don't like about it really. It's easy to set up and perform presentations to multiple people.

I often have to coordinate these phone calls with multiple participants and being able to link with my Outlook and automatically create a meeting link is invaluable.,"It is a great platform if you need to screenshare or have constant conference calls with people all over the country.

It's a great way to meet up anywhere, anytime.","GoToMeeting is user-friendly and fun to use. We have never experienced any difficulties with the program itself, most problems are by the user. For some reason, it's really difficult for some users to remember to turn off/on their microphones, it can be maddening, but that isn't GTM's fault, but if they could figure out a way to deal with that, it would be great.
It's a bit more expensive than some of the similar software out there, but we had clients who already used it, so we invested in it a few years ago.
We use it daily to talk to clients, but I really like using it to talk to other co-workers when working on a project. We can share screens and discuss, it's as good as meeting in person. It's also really nice to use whlie working at home.",It's pricey. There are a lot of choices out there. We stick with GoToMeeting because we already have it.

This ended up a major headache, and we had to argue with Support for several days before we were given an explanation or an apology.","GoToMeeting is definitely easy to use and has some great features aside from basic meetings/webinars, including Q&A and Polling.","Design-wise, GoToMeeting looks old and is a little ugly to navigate.

The addins to install on PC and Mac are lighweight and install very quickly and it still leads when connecting to different IT environments (we have never experienced having issues with a customer when using GoTo Meeting in their network), something that some remote meeting softwares haven't been able to achieve.","GoTo Meeting was our first selection when having remote meeting within our company untill last year (2019). It just works as expected, does not consume too many (computing and network) resources and works on most IT environments (incluiding our customer's). The addins install quick and easy and the sharing features are great. It usually has an admin that creates the meeting and the meeting needs to be started by the admin. Has all the basic features you would need to have a remote meeting (audio - video, screen sharing, inmersive chat, Q&A, participants list, some controls, etc) but it doesn't have had too many updates for some time and lacks some features we have found productive (whiteboard, for example).","The software works great. Nevertheless, we have found some features in other remote meeting software that could make it ideal: have anyone in your organization be able to have admin rights (create meetings, start meetings, change meeting configurations, etc) and some features that nowadays might be very useful (whiteboard, a note taking module to be able to take notes and share them when the meeting ends, more options to connect audio - to name a few)."

And I have no way of knowing if this a problem that they are working to remedy or not. It is a nuisance problem that was barely acknowledged. This entire experience was one that makes you start reviewing their competition.

Postscript:
About two hours after I found out from the customer service rep how to test the access codes for the meetings that I had created in GoToMeeting to test if they were invalid or not, I visited my GoToMeeting page. Some of the meetings were no longer there. I went to my Outlook Calendar and the meetings with the phone numbers and the access codes were still there. I called the phone numbers assigned to those meetings and dialed the access codes. The access codes were invalid. This means that someone at GoToMeeting tested all the meetings that I had created and removed those with invalid access codes.
It would have been much easier from the outset if the customer service person had simply apologized for the problem of invalid access codes rather than telling me that the error lay in my cut and paste skills. Telling someone that they are not capable of a routine as simple as cut and paste, and that their execution of that process introduced the errors is pretty silly. I discussed this situations with my supervisor who told me that our company is planning to switch to another provider.","I have used GoToMeeting off and on for both meetings and webinars for over 6 years in several environments and it works pretty consistently. Early on, there were several problems with sound and people being unable to hear intermittently but in the past few years those quality problems have apparently been resolved. It is easy to use and set up","Over the past two weeks, I have set up meetings with GoToMeetings and the access code turned out to be invalid. It occurred last week and once again today. I went to the customer support section on their website and it suggested that the access code be tested by calling in on another number. I tried this and once again received the message that the access code was invalid. I followed the process of finding a live customer support person as outlined on the site. I was connected to a classically unhelpful customer service person that I recall from a decade or so ago. Overall technology companies have moved away from outsourcing customer service matters to poorly trained, ineffective and resistant customer service teams. This individual refused to acknowledge that the problem lay with the generation of invalid access codes at their end until I worked him over with logic. I had to pull out of him the process of figuring out how to test all of the access codes I currently have in the meetings that I have set up for the next few weeks. I got him to finally admit that the problem I am having is a problem for other people too. I could not find out from him if the problem was increasing or decreasing at their end. He would not provide me with access to a supervisor or technical person responsible for monitoring and eliminating the problem of invalid access codes. It was a nightmare"

Any videoconference is very good, I can offer technical service to customers and evaluate the requirements they have to give them a better service for their websites.","GoToMeeting is a very easy to use software, with a fairly fast registration. It doesn't have a learning curve, which makes it excellent for customers who don't know the application to start using it.
When the meeting starts, it is very stable at all times: it has no audio or video performance problems. It consumes very little bandwidth and few resources of the device being used.
The web, PC and Android application is great. It has no performance flaws and maintains a great experience.","It is a very little known application outside the business world. It is common that at work we meet customers who do not use it, so we have to talk to them to use GoToMeeting or adapt to the solution that the customer offers us.
The interface looks a bit obsolete, I'd like to be able to customize it a bit."

Whenever I am invited in for a meeting via GoToMeeting, I get pretty excited over it.","The screen sharing and screen control has been a life savor for me and my coworkers. We work closely with vendors who work remotely, and having group conferences via GoToMeeting has been so sufficient. Our vendors will need to share their screen often with us so we know exactly what we need to do on our end to complete certain tasks. I wouldn't want another software as GoToMeeting makes connecting to the group a breeze!",nothing I like least about it. GoToMeeting is nothing short of top notch!

Once everyone is in the meeting it runs smoothly and the screen sharing feature is invaluable for remote work.,"I work remotely, and we use GoToMeeting for secure training meetings. We need to have a secure place to share our screens that contain sensitive health information, and GoToMeeting allows for screen sharing in a secure platform that feels like a real meeting. I like how there are dots next to each person's name that light up when they are speaking so we can easily know who in the meeting is talking.","I am the user and my experience has been easy to access, but it seems that the administrators of the meetings have a difficult time setting up the meeting. Sometimes the links sent out do not work right and they have to set up a new meeting which cuts into the meeting time. It takes awhile to get everyone in and everyone's sound working correctly, but again this could be user error, but I do feel that though I like the look and feel of this software, it could be easier to use and more user friendly with helpful tutorials."

Whether I need it because I need to share my screen with someone, or even just to use it to have as a call only option, it is versatile in any way I decide to use it",I love that I am able to share my screen with someone that may be 10 minutes away and someone on the other side of the US. I appreciate that there is never a lag or a glitch and I appreciate the ease of sharing my screen if I want to send it off to someone if they have something to show. The ability to schedule a meeting or start a meeting right away is essential in a field like construction if something needs to get planned.,"There are no cons to this software, the only thing I would recommend or would add as an option is to have the option to give someone the control of the screen and overall meeting. There have been times when the person who gave me permission to share the screen lost signal, and therefore caused the entire meeting to lose access to the screen even though it was the host's signal that was lost. This way when the host grants screen sharing to someone else, they can obtain overall control of the meeting."

You can open GoToMeeting on smartphones, tablets, and PC's, making it a seamless integration with anyone's day to day life, regardless of the pace differences between industries.",The only issue I have with GoToMeeting is that it does not have a 64-bit compatible plug-in for Outlook. Many IT professionals utilize the 64-bit version of Office because it is much better at calculating large quantities of data. They are forced to choose between the convenience of the plug-in and the efficiencies of 64-bit Excel.

It can even prevent you from having to travel to a meeting as you can participate, show documents, view documents, etc. all on your computer screen, and have a discussion with everyone just like you were sitting at the table together.","This is a great way to conference meetings and is very easy to use. The person who created the meeting can give anyone control to show their desktop, is very easy to set up and use, and even works with Outlook to send invitations, add the meeting to your calendar, etc. All attendees can see each other (if you have a camera on your PC or laptop), can easily see documents on the controlling person's PC at the same time so all attending can discuss it, and is a great way to have meetings online. Our office uses this quite a bit and we find it very convenient.","Once we had trouble accessing our account to set up a meeting, but I easily got help through their customer support and was immediately able to fix the problem."

We drive presentations and it has helped us closing deals. We completely rely on GOTO Meeting since we are from sales background. Nice online meeting tool that every organisation should consider.,Its a best online tool ever and has the features to dial in to all the countries. Recording option is one of the reason why our company has chosen this tool. We can do video conferencing and talk through the computer audio or phone audio and the best part is we can share the link and the end user can connect with us just by clicking the link.,I use this tool on a daily basis and the least like about this software is sometimes it doesn't connect but if we logout and login again it will be connected and they didn't provide us the Indian dial in number.

This allows me to show them how our software works, and in addition, if they are having troubles, I can have them show their screen as well. Without this product, my job would be ALOT more difficult.","The thing I like most is that when I have a software demo to show, GoToMeeting always starts right up, has no connection issues, and the best part is that they can dial right in using their phone, or the computer.","Sometimes when my clients are dialing in, the mention they can get the dialogue box out of the way.

The screen sharing and keyboard mouse control are key to this.,This software enabled is to train new employees across the nation remotely instead of traditional classroom training which can be wire costly in travel and expenses. We virtually did away with our on site training.,It's interface can sometimes be confusing to a less tech savvy user.

Even on corporate computer systems where installations are password protected you can still install the plugin and get this to work.,"It is easy to use. You send a link, people click on it, and you are put together in a virtual conference where you can talk and share your computer screen / presentations /etc. There's always a time someone asks you something and you just want to show someone but can't because you are not there. Here, you can be ""there"" with them and show them what you mean. Also you can host large groups for much cheaper than trying to coordinate a conference room, and people can still share ideas, ask questions, all in an organized manner.","I think having the ability to personalize your virtual conference could go a long way. Setting up interactive widgets on screen, setting up the visual field to help facilitate networking within the participants.

Both me and the party I met with through this application had a seamless transition of work which in turn helped reduce time spent on projects.","The ability to share screens and even allow the screen to be accessible by other party, is the thing I liked the most about this software. Talking to someone over the phone and trying to direct them how to navigate a webpage is difficult if they can't see it. GoToMeeting helps cut out the energy, time, and confusion of explaining by allowing screen sharing.",Sometimes the software would shut down while in the middle of a meeting.

*Users can phone in or use their computer microphones/speakers.","*It seems that there is always someone using it for the first time and they are confused and the first 5 minutes of a meeting is getting them acclimated. I think it is user friendly, but apparently it must not be intuitive because people seem to have trouble using it sometimes.
*There are glitches every once in awhile (like someone's computer microphone is too close to the speakers so there is echoing feedback). There are ways to work this out (like muting people), but it takes some experience to learn all of the tricks.

I have absolutely no complaints what so ever!!! I would highly recommend it to any one looking to connect around the world.,Pros of Go To Meeting is the fact that it so simple to use! Very easy to set up meetings between people to talk and train via a fantastic platform. I use it daily to communicate with people around the world.,Cons of Go To Meeting is that it can be a bit glitchy! Sometimes you have to reconnect or the audio gets distorted but can usually be fixed relatively quickly to get back to the task at hand and it gets the job done efficiently.

Usually we used skype as a means of communication, but some clients wanted to use GoToMeeting, so from time to time we had to use this tool. From what I remember (I have to confess that I haven't used it for some time) it was a pretty general conferencing tool with all standard features. I can't recollect any specific killing feature that wow'ed me and made me use this tool more often. Usually this tool did its job when we used it, then we put it aside till the next time. However, it looks like gotomeeting is evolving, and that's a good sign. I checked their new features and they added some that I don't remember having.
So if you are looking for a conferencing tool for your company, definitely review gotomeeting, maybe it'll be a good fit for your company.","It has all the basic functionality you need from a videoconferencing tool:
* multiple users
* video, audio and chat
* computer audio and phone support","* In the past they didn't allow to record the calls, looks like now they fixed it.
* No killing features or anything, a pretty general tool."

I'm able to share my screen and present with colleagues across the country. They are able to interact as if they are in the room. It has removed barriers when colloborating with associates and vendors-we no longer have to worry about when someone can get ""out to visit"".

I'm sure some of our problems were self-inflicted, but still, software tools like this should be straightforward and user friendly.

It's two main advantages are it's free plan and it's user interface. There's a ton of video conferencing apps that are being developed every year but I don't foresee GTM becoming any less popular for the individual to small business crowd.,"User interface is easy-to-use: creating meetings only takes a few clicks. For small business owners, you can use a custom URL to set up meetings so you can stay ""on brand"". There is a free plan available and better yet, signing up for a trial doesn't require a credit card. For individuals or small businesses, you can derive so much value for no cost.","With ease, there come some capability sacrifices. GTM lacks advanced meeting options: there is no real-time polling, video meetings are limited to six sessions and video calls cannot be recorded.

Whether meeting with colleagues in-office meetings or with clientele during the times when the parties required to meet could not physically be in the same office, GoToMeeting served our needs very well.

It is particularly handy to professionals who regularly attend meetings and conferences with fellow professionals who are quite a distance away.
With GoToMeeting, users have the power to connect remotely, but do it as if they were in the very same room.
GoToMeeting gives the users the power to make quality video calls and connect without interruptions, so long as the users' network connection is good.
The software gives the user a calendar feature as well so that the user can keep reminders for important dates, to ensure that the client does not miss any important meeting.
GoToMeeting also comes with a chat feature, with which users are able to share written messages, most of which are used to make clarifications and share further information on a point. This makes GoToMeeting a very effective tool for video conferencing.
GoToMeeting has the option of the user recording a meeting proceeding, for review at a later time.
It is very easy to install and use software that does not require the skills of an expert.

So they can share an older and then a newer version of a website that I'm writing website copy for. You can easily see what they want you to see, which is very helpful, or invite them to see your desktop if you have things to share. This is far simpler than sending frequent e-mails back and forth, saves a lot of time and effort.","If you need to remotely meet with clients or colleagues, GoToMeeting can help you feel as if you are sitting together around a conference table. You can see someone's desktop, so if they want to show you documents, spreadsheets or anything else that is critical to your meeting, you easily have access to exactly what they want you to know. There is a Pro version and also a Free version, so you can try the software out before you go to the Pro version.","If your internet connection lapses, then you're going to be disconnected from the meeting & this can be a bit disconcerting. But with today's 'net, this happens less and less than it used to. Simply be aware if a client or colleague leaves abruptly, they may be back in a few moments."

Every person and organization has their preferred tools, and this is especially evident with online meeting and collaboration solutions. Sometimes you're at the mercy of another organizations preference, which sometimes doesn't work correctly, most of the time. Where other solutions might have connection issues, or A/V issues, or camera issues, or sharing problems that require troubleshooting and impact productivity, GoToMeeting is the exception. It just works in 99.9% of scenarios.","I think the meeting start process can be a little clunky if you only need a phone conference bridge. There have been a few occasions where desktop sharing is not needed, and we just need a conference bridge, but we still need to open the website or application, login as the meeting host, and start the meeting.","I truly can't think of anything I don't like!

And the ability to have a back-up/coorganizer of the meeting. This helps a lot of you're sick and cannot open the meeting bridge for an important organizational meeting.","The meeting room is being closed after 5 mins if the host gets disconnected.

It has enabled me to ask them questions and respond in real time through comments.,"GoToMeeting is easy enough to set up once an organizer shares a link with me, which I like. I also like the chat window to the right of the video viewer. It's great to be able to have a conversation, share files, etc there. I'm fairly certain the organizers can share ""Call to Action"" buttons rigth there as well, which would be super helpful if I were on the organizer end of the meeting.","Last I used GoToMeeting it felt dated compared to, say, Zoom. Depending on my web meeting goals, I think I'd use a more recent tool like Zoom or even Google Hangouts instead of GoToMeeting. It can also be cumbersome to set up a meeting as I need to install client software on my end to attend the meeting. Another clunky piece that feels dated now."

I love the fact that I can share my screen with my students as well as take over their screen if they are needing help on their projects. Another great feature is that I am able to record and export my videos feom gotomeeting and upload them to whatever platform I'd like. It has been a great asset to my teaching process.,"The interface is a little confusing off the start. There were a lot of features I didn't know existed right off the bat.

- Flexibility of scheduling with GoTo Planner - Copy invitation link and emailing both options

No one ever seems to have issues with getting it to work on their device, which is typically the most common issue with online meetings. It is rich in functionality and very easy to use and run. I find most people have used it before, though that may be because of my situation. If you are in sales and reaching out to a variety of clients, you might find that's not as true in your case.","For what I use it for, which is mostly meetings with partners involved less than 5 attendees, GoToMeeting gets the job done and without really any issues.

I've also used AdobeConnect, however I do feel that GoToMeeting generally presents less technical issues than AdobeConnect. My favorite features of the software include the ease of recording a meeting, the ability to hand over screen control to an attendee, and the ability to join a meeting from your phone. Although other softwares offer the phone option, I do not feel that it's generally as smooth as a process as GoToMeeting.","Keep in mind that if you are paying the base rate for this software and only have one user on your account, you cannot have an employee use it or log in at the same time you are logged in to the same account. I understand why this protocol is in place, however it has caused some frustrating scenarios for our team in the past.

There are many more features that are available that I never needed too! I never had to use the customer service because I never had an issue (which is saying something) so I cannot speak to that piece of the service.","GoToMeeting is super easy to use and is very reliable. I have used it mostly for the teleconference feature to communicate with 4-15 people in a simple to use conference call. I have never had an issue with the conference call feature and the few times I used the Webcast, video feature, it worked very well too.","My only complaint about this service (and this may have been updated recently) is that when using a mobile phone to view the conference call info and call in, there was not an easy to use feature to enter the conference pin number. A simple solution would be to create the invitation to have the phone number, then the pin number as an extension that smart phones would recognize. Many outside sales people use these and are often in their car. Make this as easy as possible!"

It is always a helpful tool to be able to screen share and be able to present information. Being able to get a list of who was on the meeting after is always helpful and being able to record to show those who were not able to attend is great.,"There are sometimes bugs that cannot be explained. Example we were giving a presentation to a group of people and somehow one of our customers that was on the call got access to presentation mode (without us giving them access) and we were not able to see it on our end (until we saw the recorded video we did for our meeting) and it was just showing them looking through their email, and doing what ever they were doing on their computer. They didn't know they were in presentation mode, but you could still hear our speakers voice. So it was a bad experience for all. Without getting gotowebinar it would be nice to be able to have people sign up for the meeting online before the event and get an email for the event before."

The pricing is fair but you also have a free trial to let you use their tools at no cost.","One thing that I really enjoy about Go To Meeting is I can quickly schedule a webinar/meeting for a date in advance, or I can send a quick link to join something right then with a customer, prospect or vendor. I have never had any issues with latency or connection, once you get used to the controls it is a simple tool.","As I mentioned above, G2M is great once you get used to the controls.

I would still choose it over other systems for large group meetings such as training sessions.","GoToMeeting has too cons. First, they required that we sign a multi-year contract. This prevented us from scaling up and down as our business changed. A 3-year contract for a startup is a non-starter. Second, I don't like having to download a client to get into a meeting.

It would be useful outside of work also. Schools would find it very helpful; students could use it for group projects, tutoring, and many other options.","It is so easy to have a meeting with people who are not in your office. You can talk over the phone or chat through the computer. It is absolutely the most easiest way to have a quick little conference without spending money to meet in person. You can control anyone's computer screen if you need to troubleshoot their computer, or just to show them what is on your screen so everyone can see it. It really is amazing in my opinion. You set up the meeting on your calendar, it sends a message with the info to everyone and they just call the number for the phone conference and log on with their computer. It's very simple to figure out.","I think it can be intimidating for someone who is not very computer savvy, but once they realize how easy it is, they will see that it just looks complicated! Some areas of my computer could not be accessed by the other person, I had to make the selections, but I believe that is because of security features on my computer.

Get everyone together easily,24/6/2018,"Great interface, good pricing options, a robust piece of software...get a license you will not be disappointed.","Very easy to use, send out an invitation and people can join from anywhere. Fantastic reliability and service considering we will often have our ""all hands"" meetings with this platform, and can 100+ individuals simultaneously virtually connected from all over the world. Great and simple interface with all the features you would need to pass control of a meeting, call in/chat options, and video conferencing. Pricing is very reasonable.","If you get too many people (200+) you can start running into performance issues. Of course with that many people in a meeting you have other considerations, Im not sure if that still counts as a meeting or more of a presentation. Too many video feeds severely impacts performance, but that is to be expected."

It isn't as fancy as zoom, but definitely it gets the job done. The best part is that it can be used with only a simple web download, no additional IT permissions needed (although this will depend on your IT rules...most of our clients have not encountered any issues the way they have with zoom).","It can be used very easily in a web browser and has all the functionalities that you would need for a video conference software - multiple participants, screen sharing, and the ability to turn your camera/microphone on or off. You can also call in to the meeting as well. Great functionality that can be shared with clients who don't have the software installed - it can be downloaded and run without the need for fancy IT permissions (for those with corporate laptops) as is the case with zoom.","It lacks a lot of the more sophisticated bells and whistles that come with zoom, like private chat and the ability to ""react"" to things. You also cannot give screen control permissions. However, these also are rarely used functions even in zoom for us."

The meetings use less network bandwidth so there is smooth usage for meetings and the features like screenshare, chat, fileshare and much more are very useful during the meetings.","The application allows very good number enough for any team within the organization to conduct the meetings but more number of users means more use of bandwidth then previously it use to hang, bit with latest updates this has been fixed."

There are cheaper options available out there but gotomeeting is the premium one. Every vendor or client i work with is already used to gotomeeting.,I think this is the global standard for e conferences. We tried a few different ones including Zoom and GoToMeeting won in every aspect. Menu options are simple and easy. It's all on your face. No auto hiding menus or anything like that. I hate those auto hiding menus from other providers. You drag and drop to adjust screen size. Simple and easy compared to 10 different buttons that other providers have. Chat tool is easy. Lift of participants is clearly layed out. Settjng up new meetings scheduling is very user friendly.,I don't use outlook and it tends to by default open outlook with meeting details. Maybe that's a setting on my computer to change my default email client.

I happened to visit the website and was amazed to find the CURRENT rate is about $21.00 Canadian for the same service.
They screwed me and my company for several years and NEVER contacted me to offer a better rate.
I am disappointed!
I cancelled the service today!
They never even asked why I cancelled!
I will not go back to them - even if they offered to refund whatever amount they ""overcharged"" me - not even if they offered the overcharge and interest. I treat my customers with integrity and I expect that from my suppliers! I will not deal with an organization that rewards their faithful customers with higher than market price!"

Can complain about that! Good product and I would recommend.,I enjoy how easy it is for others to use. This was often used for benefit meetings and many of our field employees are not as computer savvy. This was helpful. I also like how I could see if my screen isn't sharing as I use 3 monitors so it is easy to be sharing the wrong screen. Letting others take control is important as I have used this to have someone show me an error when they are going through enrollment. We use GoToMeeting for many things but this has made things for me so much easier.,"I have had times where it was slow, or we had audio issues but that can also depend on connections etc. I also didn't like that I couldn't record a session at least with out version, that seems outdated in this day in age."

Rather than a simple online meeting with video and screen sharing, you can interact on a deeper level with application sharing. Whether using this for my business and interacting with clients or using it with my son and his various teachers through his online school, I'm very impressed with how versatile this software is. GoToMeeting is a great solution for organizations, businesses and schools of all sizes.","As with all software that is more complex, there are some issues with this software which is easy to simple endure due to all of its benefits.

Be it online presentations, conference calls or desktop sharing, it just works. The quality of the product itself is good as it manages to cope with classic issues like varying bandwith or participants across different platforms. Coming from an age of landline conference calls and vlc based improvised screensharing you will like GoTo Metting especially regarding the reliability and quality of Service it provides.","The main drawbacks of GoToMeeting we encountered were a fiddly setup regarding invitations especially when send across timezones. GoTos Web frontend became confused with destination, Browser, System, local and target timezones. Probably this is resolved by now but it was a painfull experience. Also, participants are often not technicians and so we encounered some nasty mixups regarding audio setup especially across cultural gaps and expectations. Again there is room for simplification and technically supported guidance. Probably this is something in the works allready as well."

I wouldn't say there's anything incredibly great or special about the software, but it gets the job done and allows you to talk and meet online with multiple people, so I'd recommend it.","I like how easy it is to schedule everyone, since that is always the hardest part of getting people together. The program also sends reminders to your guests, which is helpful so you don't have to annoy people personally. Additionally, I like how the software has ""individual"" mode and ""group"" mode that easily lets everyone either watch one individual talk or have access to videos of everyone talking.","Occasionally, when someone logs in on their phone rather than their computer, it causes an echo when they speak. It's not horrible, but it can be annoying. Also, I wish the program had an easier way for people in ""individual"" mode to indicate they have a question, like a bell or a signal, so the individual talking knows when to stop talking and answer it, or to continue talking and get to the question later. Currently the other users just have to talk on their end to indicate they have something to say, and that can cause a lot of annoying interruptions."

It is a frequent method of communication in our office, and it brings together employees from remote locations into virtual meetings that flow well and facilitate great communication.","It's straightforward and easy to use, when setting up meetings as the organizer or as an attendee. Screen sharing is a breeze, and you can focus on the information being shared, rather than on technical issues as is often the case when using some other programs. Meetings and conference calls are smooth and effective, as we can get right to the material being discussed and don't have to fumble through settings. It's been a great tool and I highly recommend GoToMeeting.","Once or twice we had time zone conflicts, where someone's computer was not on the correct time zone.

Sometimes certain settings reset and you have to readjust to hear/see. It can sometimes be a process to get logged in as well.,"Features seem to be lacking. This is not a one stop shop solution.
When it comes to other solutions in the same market, GoTo Meeting seems to be lacking a lot of the functionality of others. They have 2 separate solutions for hosting a meeting vs hosting a presentation, which seems odd. Lately the numbers generated to dial into the meeting with phone audio have been giving me busy signals forcing me to use my computer for audio."

There have not been any glitches so far and I would highly recommend this product to anyone with members or employees in different cities or countries even. The cost is not too high and easy to set up.,There is nothing bad about this product from my point of view. The only thing that could be easier is by adding more people to the meeting instead of sending invites one at a time.

Last but not least your meeting can have up to 250 joint users, which is quite an impressive number.","If you internet connection is bad it would not work properly.

1) Sometimes it was crash for now apparent reason, essentially ending the meeting for everyone involved. We'd then have to prompt everyone to rejoin.

There are a vairety of teleconference/video conference options out there, and having tried many this is one I highly recommend. It allows non-tech saavy peers to participate, average users to perform above-average, and skilled computer users to excel. It measures up to the biggest players.","A real competitor for the biggest players in this market, with a full suite of conference options and software. The free trial was impressive. No glitches or dropped calls, and the presenting and video are simple and of high quality.","The set up was a bit convoluted, especially moving from the free trial to a full business solution."

It's perfect for meetings face to face, and for sharing your screen and includes lots of options for calling in or joining through computer.","It has so many windows! The window that shows a person's screen or their webcam is different than the screen you use to mute yourself or have other meeting controls. It can be confusing trying to find the right window and is the biggest downside to GoToMeeting.

It is a little pricey but the features you get make up for that.,"A great tool for conference calls, online meetings, and even some light remote support. Options for computer or phone audio work fairly well. Gives organizers and other attendees information about who is in the meeting and who is speaking if those user dial in correctly or use computer audio. Seems to have pretty good audio quality as well and the presentation tools work great.","Can be difficult for some that are not computer savvy to use, especially when it comes to setting up the audio. Many times people who dial in and join from a computer at the same time will not use their audio pin so it renders some of the attendee info useless. This is probably not really a limitation of the software but more of a misunderstanding of how to use it. GoToMeeting is fairly pricey for multiple organizers."

Not only is it easy to set up a large conference call, but it's also easy for those that have never used it on the other end. The only thing to worry about is making sure the users that are calling in have the software downloaded before the meeting starts to minimize delays. Nowadays, GoToMeeting is used by so many companies, it's almost ubiquitous.

It's easy to control the meeting in the sense of seeing who's online, changing presenters, recording meetings, etc. It just works.","A few things I didn't love about GoToMeeting was that when I was presenting to a ""non-technical"" audience, they consistently required hand holding to get them to a point of being able to view my screen, and it wasn't always easy to figure out, as I couldn't see their screen.

The options of live web cams is great when you need a face to face meeting but also allows you to include those who may only be able to conference in via cell phone or landline at at once.

They offer a great service and product that allow for productive online meetings. It would be great if they were web-based and people didn't have to download a program, but I think that having a program download helps their quality.","I love the quality of this product and the gap in communication that it solves. It is a platform that allows you to video-chat with other people, share documents, share screens, open a chat, etc. The ease of scheduling, inviting other participants, and hosting an online meeting are very important to the attractiveness of this software.","I least like the fact that it is something that you have to download. The software is not web-based, but instead, everyone who wants to be on the call has to download the software and open it when attending the meeting. It's not a horrible inconvenience, but if you don't have it and try to download right before the meeting it can be a lengthy process. I've noticed that they try to solve that problem by including language in the invite email about checking compatibility, but I always assume that no one reads that information."

I appreciate the ability to meet virtually with colleagues who are geographically dispersed. The ability to upload a slide set or other materials provides a visual element that helps keep our meetings on track, and is far superior to sharing materials through another medium and doing a conference call. Training and support materials are generally easy to find and helpful. Log in for meeting attendees is logical and easy. You can also record sessions for sharing later.","I don't have a lot of ""cons"" about this software as it generally meets my needs. There are some aspects of it that could be more intuitive (like presenting or screen sharing)."

This makes disseminating information to a large group much more efficient, and allows others from far away to participate. Also would be good for in business if you travel, but need to have a meeting with your colleagues who are not with you.","I really like Go-To Meeting because of the ease of logging in. It also shows who else is logged in with you, it allows for a chat-room style, or use of microphone, and you can record it and make it available for viewing later. You can also also run powerpoints on the screen for your attendees.","Sometimes I had trouble connecting my mic, but probably more user error than the actual program itself.

I've used most of the other competitors and none of them come close to the usability and professional option that is GTM.,GTM is a code element to keeping our team organized and presenting well on conference calls and screen-shares. The best feature is the ease of use. I don't have time to learn a new program. GTM has also been very reliable for us and we've rarely run into problems with it.,The only thing I don't like about GTM is that sometimes I am automatically logged out of the program and it generally happens at times where I am right about to be late for a conference call.

The prices sometimes might be a hindering issue if you don't feel like investing on meetings that nobody has to pay to participate.

And it allowed me immediately to carry out product presentations and remote sales. But it is also used in our internal meetings as we have offices in several countries. This allows us to communicate in a simple way with good audio quality thanks to the telephone call function.,"It remains computer software subject to an internet connection. From time to time it happens that it cuts. When the meetings exceed the scheduled time it happens that we are cutting what is annoying.

We work with teams across the globe all the time. Instead of talking on the phone, GTM allows us to teleconference instead. We work with a lot of financial data in software such as Excel, so GTM lets me share my screen and show people my work. When dealing with complex information, the ability to show others your work is key. GTM has also been a godsend with the ease of its meeting creation. It actually has cut costs for us, and makes my job a whole lot easier.","I really enjoy the ability to share my desktop with others in the meeting. My company uses GTM quite often, and I need the ability to show data and figures that are on my desktop--which I can. I also like how GTM gives you the ability to draw on your screen. When I'm sharing my desktop, the drawing tool allows me to point things out to coworkers more easily.","I dislike how there is a cap on webcams during a meeting. Quite often I have meetings that are greater than six people, yet we can only have videoconferencing for six people. This is definitely something that I would suggest be changed."

Straight forward and if you really do get stuck and need help, google is your best friend. Calls are clear, never had any real issue with lag. You can easily share your screen to attendees which keeps everyone on the same page especially working with spreadsheets for collaborative work.","Price, the pricing scheme is a bit much. I can find other tools out there that can provide more for similar price. There is no ""parking"" of attendees. For instance, if the host has not started the meeting, nothing happens.

Also, if you are in an office that requires multiple meetings to be in session simultaneously, GoToMeeting is worthwhile (due to its separation of codes, call-in #s, by meeting). If you just need these occasional teleconference over the phone, it's not worth subscribing.","GoToMeeting works very well. It is simple to use, has no issues with glitches, etc., and is able to serve the dual function of both conference calls and video calls. I like how each meeting that is created generates a unique log in link, call in number, and code - this helps cut down on confusion when there are a lot of meetings going on.","The only downside of GoToMeeting is that it costs money. There are free conference call options available out there, so it may seem odd to some to pay for a service. However, a lot of these free services do not offer video calls, and if they do, don't have the screen sharing capabilities, etc. that GoToMeeting has."

It is possible to set the main organiser, as well as co-organisers who are able to modify settings and the event flow. Also, you can add just a speaker, who is able to see limited settings, and is added simply to do their speaking part.","I did not like the way how it switches from one speaker to another, it was not smooth. Also, the camera use is not straight forward, there are no instructions how to set up the small camera on the side while you are speaking, how to take it off, how to combine many cameras etc. In my opinion, it could be set up in a simpler way, that anyone can join and understand how to use it.

Figuring out how to remote control of a workstation seem much more intuitive in terms of layout.,"Although I like the remote control feature sometimes control of the workstation gets choppy. You will have to release control and request control to address the issue. Sometimes user on the other end needs to take action. I'm not sure if this is a con because I have seen this on other platforms, but when you attempt to install software on a machine remotely that require admin privileges the person remoting in can not apply their credentials.

The second con is that depending on how locked down your infrastructure is as far as security goes, you'll find that you can have a hard time joining a meeting. We have our endpoints extremely locked down and ran into multiple cases where people were unable to join a meeting due to our security.

It is so easy to use and the functionality is amazing. Being able to communicate over the cloud and hold meetings virtually is great. They have so many great functions and it is so user friendly.

The software hasn't matured much, and owes most of its performance gains to better bandwidth. For large enterprises, standardizing on a platform such as WebEx or GoToMeeting makes sense, especially if international participants are going to be dialing in. However, Skype for Business (nee Lync) offered the best integration and presence notifications, and it is difficult to justify the large expenditure for switching to GoToMeeting. In summary, while a capable application and telepresence tool, there's nothing so compelling about it to make the switch from a competitor. If you work in the corporate world, odds are you're going to be using a mix of WebEx, GoToMeeting, and even Google Hangouts. Citrix has done nothing to push people away from this product, but equally done nothing to set it apart from its competitors.",Integrates well with Outlook and meetings are easy to set up and use,"No real standout features - quality is fine, but too complex for simple 1:1 chats.

I like to use the polling function to make sure my audience is still paying attention and to gauge how they are taking the material in.,To be able to spin up a meeting within minutes and get it out to either tens of people or hundreds of people is very simple. You don't have to worry about how people are consuming the meeting since it works on all devices with an internet connection. If you want to poll your audience on the fly is so simple just ask the poll question and type the answers and send it. It's a great way to keep your audience engaged and keep the interest up and know that your audience is still listening.,It would be nice if you could take screenshots from the full-screen mode as you can from the standard screen mode.

No one I work with has had any issues with using it.","You have to invite people using your calendar software instead of using G2M. It doesn't support recording, which is a HUGE deal.

Now that I am comfortable using it, the features are great. In a new position, the ""present now"" feature is great as I can be on with my boss and he can literally see what I am doing and be able to help me figure out what I am doing wrong or answer my questions because he can visually see what I am doing. It is also so quick and easy to schedule that you can do it in seconds.","Having started a new job, I did not use GoToMeeting before. Now, all I have to do is a few clicks and my meeting invitation is out and on my schedule. I like that it has so much functionality and it takes the concept of scheduling a meeting and makes it so simple. The fact that it puts it directly on your calendar with all the information you need, you just click the link when the meeting time rolls around and your connected. I also like that you can be involved in the meeting via voice and don't necessarily have to be on video.","I really did not know how to use it, and had to have someone talk me through it initially. Once I knew what to do, it was very easy. I also did not know how the ""present now"" feature worked until someone showed me. I don't know if there is a ""welcome"" tutorial for new users, but I would find that very helpful."

For example, if you are working on a branding project, you can set periodic update meetings to present the materials so far and get live feedback from the team. If your client is out of state, you can easily set a meeting to share and update them on projects.","The only thing I didn't like about the software is that it constantly downloaded new versions of itself instead of overwriting with the updated software.

They are able to actually see what we are disussing, verses us saying ""turn to page 4 and look halfway down the page"".

It makes communication easy and it also allows Owners to see my face and connect with me. This helps with building support rapport and strengthens the ties between the franchise and franchisees.,What I like about GoToMeeting is the ease of use. I use this software for a Marketing Webinar that connects our Franchise headquarters with franchisees. I can see who is on the webinar and also a link is automatically generated on the site. The link can later be sent to those who missed out on the live recording.,I do not like that the comments are shown on a different tab on the software. It confused me at first but it was simple to figure out.

Sometimes flaky,13/4/2018,"Setting up a conference call and/or screen share couldn't be much simpler. Login to the website, or desktop client if you've downloaded it and ""Meet Now"", or schedule in the future. You'll want a decent connection to the internet or you may come across lag in a screen share session and voice quality can diminish.","If you are on the lower end of a network connection, you can expect to have a 2-3 second delay when taking over the keyboard and mouse from a user.

Its basically a do-all program, and much cheaper than the next step up (GoToWebinar).
The login process is easy for invited users, which means fewer panicked emails from attendees trying to join, and that's always nice for the host.","You cannot create personalized login links for each attendee, and there is no built-in recording sharing. If you want to share the recording of the meeting, you will need to host it yourself."

It's also easy to switch who is sharing the screen, and to work collaboratively.","I think my main cons about go to meeting is the customer service I have received from their company when contacting them about questions. I also think that there isn't much customer support in general, or really an online community that can help you answer your questions.

Whereas it is part of our workflow and established at this point, it just has too many issues pop up. Users don't find it as simple as Zoom, it isn't part of their daily workflow like Slack or Teams, and it feels somewhat dated in terms of giving every user too much up front with the UI. It turns off a lot of our clients when they have to deal with GoToMeeting issues, which isn't our fault, but it still impacts us.","It is simple to use and in most cases fires up and you're in the meeting.

Often times, people are unable to follow along and keep up with the pace of a meeting. GoToMeeting allows users to take over their machine, if necessary. I would only use this option as a last resort for a participant. I also like that you can conduct a GoToMeeting anywhere and are not restricted to use it simply on a laptop; this software works wherever the participant has an Internet connection.","The call-in process can be tricky. If you have the app on your phone or laptop, then joining the meeting is a cinch. However, there are times that the Internet connection can be finicky and not work.

We use it at our company in order to conference in and train salespeople all around the country. Typically, we train rooms of 20-50 people, and the audio quality and video quality is excellent. The screen-sharing option is also extremely helpful, as it allows us to move through presentations or navigate our website as we train salespeople. The chat function also allows trainees to pop in with questions throughout.","It has a slight learning curve that isn't difficult to overcome, but the ease of use isn't always intuitive.

But its also less than absolutely simple and intuitive. That being said, know yourself, if you're good at navigating technology, then by all means, use GoToMeeting, but if your like myself, you might consider doing what I ended up doing and stick with Google Hangout.","GoToMeeting is a robust platform which provided me with all of my needs (and then some) for conducting online workshops and information sessions. When I was running a non-profit organization GoToMeeting was the first platform I used for conducting teaching seminars. Although not being tech savvy it was a bit awkward, nonetheless, it was nice having the ability to bring people together in face-to-face teaching/learning encounters over cyberspace.","As mentioned, I am not entirely tech savvy. My biggest problem using GoToMeeting was that, as robust as it is, it is not the best solution for somebody like myself who requires a more straightforward solution. GoToMeeting was simply to complex for me. My students weren't impressed with my disability to navigate a platform which, for them, might have been easy. So although there is a lot you can do with GoToMeeting if you are proficient, if you aren't proficient in the skills needed to use it, you might just find yourself aggravated and frustrated."

So, I can use it to connect with other employees of my company and train them on web analytics without having to leave my desk.

GoToMeeting software also allows me to remotely share wire-frames of a new feature or application my development team is going to launch with product owners. And help them understand my tagging and reporting strategy to measure success of the feature.","GoToMeeting remote video meetings software makes sharing audio through phone a confusing task. If the settings of audio are not adjusted accurately or muted, it can cause voice of participant to echo while speaking through the phone. Additionally, GoToMeeting software may not work the best when latest version of Adobe Flash is not installed on your computer. Or, if the computer being used for conference calls doesn't have enough random access memory. For example, RAM lower than 4 GB may cause interruptions in calls."

It only takes a minute to register. There are so many things that I enjoy about GoToMeeting. The software allows you to call multiple people at the same time. After setting up a group call you can invite people to join it and what is more, the people you are inviting (e.g. sending links) do not necessarily register to enjoy free calls. What I personally find most useful feature of the software is that it syncs perfectly with your calendar on your phone, for example, and reminds you upcoming events if necessary.","Since it is a simple software to use, I do not think there are too many things unlikable about the software. However, I would like to point out that the software has not been updated significantly since I have started using it. I would really love the software to be upgraded from time to time and give us more functionalities.","- Use of battery on mobile device is much higher than alternative solutions

I'll give credit to GTM for improving the product lately, with mobile options now available that make things convenient if you're on the go, plus having decent Linux support (useful if you have devs on your team who prefer Linux, like I've experienced).","However...GTM doesn't have the feature-richness, reliability, or convenience of other competitors like Zoom or Hangouts Meet For one, if you're already using a calendar suite like Google Calendar (as part of GSuite), there's not much added value to using GTM of Hangouts Meet, because you'd have to spend the effort generating a GTM link and copy/pasting it into every event you make. Video quality/reliability and the breadth of countries offered for dial-in number options aren't as great as Zoom... and the UI for GTM can be rather clunky at times compared with Zoom/Hangouts Meet."

The tool is simple for the users who set up meetings, and for attendees who are handheld throughout the entire process of using GTM. GTM is great for running online meetings with colleagues or for presenting to outside parties. The ease of use prohibits GTM from any complicated features, but in my experience I have never needed 6 webcams going at once. The biggest limitation is the inability to record video meetings for future reference.","GoToMeeting (GTM) is a very useful webinar/conferencing program. It allows the user to easily set up video conferences and do video/powerpoint presentations. Further, the simplicity of GTM allows for new users to get set up on GTM minutes before a meeting, and without the need for assistance or training. Additionally, attendees to the meeting are able to listen via their computer or by calling into the meeting with their phones.","GTM is simple to use, but overall is limited in its ability to perform more advanced functions. It is unable to perform functions such as recording a video call, unable to poll members of the call and unable to handle more than 6 webcams at a time.

You don't have to have a background in video conferencing to use it, and you don't have to be a huge tech person to understand it. You don't need formal training in order to operate it.

The free option allows me to create an almost instant online conference for a few attendees, without having to jump through endless ""sign up now"" hoops. Just a few clicks and my meeting is ready to go, and I have a link that I can send out to my attendees.","What I don't like about GoTo Meeting, is that it's not a reliable source for video conferencing.

If tou arent near a computer you can call into the meeting from your phone so the platform is kinda flexible.,The audio for the meetings were barely acceptable. Now this could be due to the microphone on the devices used but it always seemed kinda garbled everytime i used the software.
