1,1 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Luis Daniel R.,Lead Application Developer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,4,5,3,10,“An essential asset for your team”,"Overall: For me, personally it's the best app to connect remotely available in the market. Anydesk is a good second.",23/12/2019,"Pros: You'll be able to utilize this software to remotely connect to either assist your clients, manage your sytstems remotely, connect to a server, transfer files or execute commands from anywhere in the world. You can bookmark all your connections and manage them in groups and view the status of the machines from a simple side window.","Cons: The license can be a little expensive and sometimes the software may lag if the client you're connecting too is outdated. You need to look up the licenses because even the cheapest one, unless you buy a volume license, you need to be specific on how many people will be using the license and only one can use it at the time."
2,2 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Emir O.,Expert asociate,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,4,3,4,5,10,“Great app for assisting friends and family”,"Overall: This is the app i use for remote assitance for private use. Problems i encountered over the years usualy have workarounds, but main thing is that you can in matter of minutes access remote PC and do the magic.",19/9/2020,Pros: It is easy to use. In a few minutes anybody with low tech skills can install client and send you data needed for remote assistance. It works with great even with fairly slow internet connection. My number one solution for private usage,"Cons: Well price for companies for premium solutions is overpriced. There is no Wayland support for Ubuntu, and also remote access to some Android devices is limited. When i bought licence few years ago, after some time i could not use licence. When they release new bigger version you loose you licence ( payed 500). Also montly fee is fairly too high especialy for 3rd world countries."
3,3 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Alison W.,PowerSchool Administrator,,2+ years,3,2,3,3,3,3,“Team Viewer works as a screen sharing program for institutions but is tricky to navigate for users.”,"Overall: For within an organization, the product is great for screen sharing, but outside it is just clunky.",16/11/2017,"Pros: I like that Team Viewer has free and paid options for users versus enterprise, it ensures that you have a quality product, but does not then price-gouge the occasional user. Team Viewer is a great alternative for screen sharing when you are able to have the time to figure out the tools, or have an IT Staff who are able to set it up for you and then train you for a simple navigation. I have had good success with companies contacting me through Team Viewer, but never in the other direction.","Cons: There are several things I did not like about Team Viewer. First, Team Viewer is very clunky to use. In terms of just setting up an account, there were steps that we (me and IT) did online and on the application, which also duplicated themselves. There were authorizations that seemed unnecessary. After downloading, the launched application still had to ""okay"" the computer, with further steps authorizing the machine through email, which were already done as part of setup. We acquired Team Viewer to share a work machine and a personal machine, with the personal account being the initiating account on the work machine, and the work account being the recipient. Due to, as Support said, too many similar characters in the two emails, they were flagged as being from the same organization even though the domains were completely different. Even with support, the issue was not resolvable. The screen sharing is extremely slow on a fairly open (no one was working) 300 mg pipe, which flies for everything else. In the end, we decided it was easier to work with two work machines for what we were trying to do, acquired a few external HDs and just used Remote Desktop. I have had success with other companies contacting me through Team Viewer, but have never been able to initiate back to them. Again, despite supports help, it is like my account is ""flagged"" to always be from organization to organization with little hope of resolution."
4,4 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Francisco Javier S.,CEO,Computer & Network Security,2+ years,5,5,,4,4,9,“A great way to offer remote support”,"Overall: We are using teamviewer to support nearly 200 computers in several countries and the daily use it's really useful. The overall image quality is good and the integrated chat, options to update remotely, reboot, block remote enter, etc makes teamviewer a great support tool. Really advisable",21/7/2020,"Pros: If you manage a lot of computers (in my case around 200), its an invaluable solution. It let's you to organize computers in groups to easily access it in a dissatend way. The possibility to add a password to a common use PC it's really helpful. And the portable version TeamviewerQS gives you a great flexibility to help a sporadic customer. The installation is completely transparent to firewall so it's really easy to deploy","Cons: The support to android devices is a separate license. In my case, have 3 licenses to pc but would have only one license to android, because it's rarely used, but the licenses system of teamviewer require to have the same number to any system. So finally, we decide to not contract this part. The other cons happens with any equipment that have started the software with a non-administrative account because when an elevated privileges process occurs, the screen to introduce the password it's not seen on the teamviewer agent computer. It can be solved with a work-around starting the software with windows credentials type instead of teamviewer credentials, but it's annoying"
5,5 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Jeheen Mahmood Z.,Senior Data Analyst,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,,5,4,8,"“If you are providing remote serice, you need this”","Overall: This is a robust workhorse for any and all remote assistance, resource maintanance tool. In my years of use, I have only seen it fail a couple of times. There were some issues with network, but that is not TeamViewer's fault. Do keep in mind, to get the best out of this tool, you should have a stable network on both ends.",8/9/2020,"Pros: This is the most stable remote access tool I have tested, and I tested an awful lot of them. The file transfer feature works like a charm and is very secure, if you are worried about privacy. Being a remote employee, I have to use PCs all over the world pretty frequently. TeamViewer has proved to be the most stable tool for that. The remote access without assistance feature is especially helpful for a project manager who needs to maintain assests in separate locations.","Cons: To be honest, the sound settings is a little confusing to set up. While on a call it gets tangled up with the call Skype/Slack/Hangouts etc) and creates very irritating screeching noise and/or feedback. It is best to turn of the sound. I guess you can use TeamViewer for calls as well, but I never figured it out as we are pretty much embedded into Slack :D Also the price is rather steep. It is hard for small teams to afford the tool. But if remote work is a core component of your project, you simply have to manage."
6,6 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Samiksha N.,Computer Teacher,Education Management,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,10,“Secure and Fast Remote Desktop Control.”,"Overall: I normally use TeamViewer to solve any issues thet my students come across. They were easily able to learn to use TeamViewer within a single day of training. I help them on projects and assignments using TeamViewer if they aren't able to solve it. They also help out each other in different occasions via teamwork. I have also been working as a part time computer technician so TeamViewer comes in handy there too. Overall, it has been a great and satisfying journey to be able to integrate TeamViewer in my daily life to solve my problems efficiently.",3/9/2020,Pros: Free access and cross platform support is the best thing about TeamViewer. Even the free version can satisfy all your basic needs without having you to pay a single cent. The software has a great user interface and is very easy to use and get used to. Its very versatile and can be used from both home and office.,Cons: I have been using TeamViewers for quite a few years but have never ever been across any noticeable lags and glitches. The app is smooth as butter and has helped me and my students a lot.
7,7 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Anoop K.,Scientific assistant,Research,2+ years,5,5,,5,5,8,“Very friendly and best one so far”,Overall: Overall quite happy and using it daily and covers all the grounds needed.,23/9/2020,Pros: Setting up software has extremely smooth workflow because of which it is possible to set it up within few minutes. Gaining remote access to registered computers without keeping a note on ID is an advantage. Android app with DeX support makes it much more convenient to use it without carrying heavy devices.,"Cons: Has old and same UI. An upgrade for the interface would be really nice. Remote transfer of file are quite slow even on optic fiber network., I feel an optimization of choosing from P2P or routed through their servers would result in better transfer rates."
8,8 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Sheikh S.,Admin Assistant,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,,5,3,9,“My primary tool to assist layman colleagues”,"Overall: In the hour of immediate need and assistance, TeamViewer is an amazing tool that can be deployed to resolve system administration issues to resume the workflow. It's saved the hassle of resolving software issues in person multiple times and will always be used by us.",27/9/2020,"Pros: The entry barrier to using this software with the second party is amazing. They just need to provide the number and password displayed on the software and you're on your merry way to resolving the issue. The connection is almost instantaneous and the keyboard shortcuts also work great. The option to audio call during the remote session is great, and can be controlled from the mobile phone as well.","Cons: Since a lot of people have been working from home, the connection can get a bit unstable and lead to difficulty in controlling remotely due to lag. Also, the ability to send somewhat large files is an annoyance due to size and speed limits."
9,9 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Nina G.,IT Support Analyst,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,,4,3,10,“O melhor de todos”,"Overall: Eu considero o melhor software para atendimento remoto, pois não dependemos de aceitação do outro lado, isso torna o processo mais rápido e eficiente.",8/9/2020,"Pros: O produto conta com uma interface simples e intuitiva, não havendo necessidade de muito tempo de uso para entender todo processo. As atualizações são avisadas logo quando abrimos o software e somos advertidos quando o ""cliente"" está utilzando uma versão anterior a nossa.","Cons: Exige bastante da conexão de todos os participantes, tornando o processo as vezes extremamente lento."
10,10 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Daniel Q.,IoT CAB Manager,Consumer Electronics,2+ years,4,5,4,4,4,8,“Good tool for remote assistance”,Overall: We used TeamViewer as a free trial software to perform minor remote assistance in some desktop/laptops and the overall experience was great. It was quick and has an easy connection with host.,21/8/2020,"Pros: Easy platform to connect to host. TeamViewer is quite fast and I didn't realize any kind of connection lost/delay, which is really important.","Cons: To proceed to company-level access, it is required to pay for this acquisition. Since our company don't have this partnership, we decided to not move forward."
11,11 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Neel P.,Technical Specialist,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,,5,5,10,"“Sold, Multiplatform Remote Access and Viewing Solution, with some issues”","Overall: I highly recommend TeamViewer -- I had recommended it to several counterparts at peer firms, and have started to use the personal version with my own computers. Several of my users have started using it with their own family and friends once they saw how easy the program is to set up and use.",23/10/2020,"Pros: I love how easy this program is to use across many device platforms -- Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android. I really like how it allows full control over computers and Android devices. It is rock solid for screen viewing on iPhone, and is really easy to get a user into a support session. It works well and maintains a solid, unfaltering connection even when our available alternatives (Zoom, Teams, Skype for Business, Quick Assist for Windows 10) fail. The device details that the program displays has helped me correct issues that users don't even know they have and suggest updates that users don't even realize that they lack.","Cons: While the remote screen viewing feature is rock solid on iPhones, the connection seems to be lost very frequently on iPad devices. When this bug is acting up, the product is almost unusable on affected devices. On iOS in general, the OS seems to prompt for disconnection very often on some devices (seems like older devices only in my limited experience). If the user is not paying attention and hits the button to close the screen share, reconnection is required."
12,12 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,,5,5,9,“Good and most importantly secure software”,Overall: Overall it's a good remote desktop access tool which has a great features like recording and data share. This helps the teams to work faster which helps to increase productivity/efficiency and in turn helps in achieving the timelines. I would recommend this software. It's really helps you setup or install software on the clients system.,18/10/2020,"Pros: The best part of the software is that it's fast. I use it on my phone too and it works great without any lags of buffer. It's easy to use with simple UI. Next thing which I like about this software is that only one license is required That is is I had paid version then, client side paid version is not required which makes use hassle free. Another great feature is the recording part. This feature helps the team understand things better also, helps the development team to debug the issue much better. It's really easy to setup/install/uninstall software or configure system on client side using teamviewer. It actually makes QA- Client life easy :) It's great remote desktop access tool with which you can also share files. So, while in conference calls, this feature is very convenient when you want to share something with client its quick and easy. This software make the work easy and fast for sure. Furthermore, for remote software security is very important especially when you are working with client. I never faced any issue with security on client side as well. Configuring client's system was quite easy and quick. So, for me it's a good and safe software.","Cons: There are popups to upgrade team viewer which is sometimes annoying as you are in middle of something and upgrade popup comes up to switch version. I mean this can be times or run in background some fix is needed for this. Coupe of times I also faced problems while sharing large files maybe it's internet, I'm not sure, But this takes your time and is not good."
13,13 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Michael P.,IT Director,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,5,5,,4,4,10,“Used daily by busy IT team”,"Overall: Now that a lot of our employees are stuck working from home, we can quickly support them in their PC troubleshooting needs without having to be locally present.",8/7/2020,Pros: We have TeamViewer integrated with Ninja RMM and is heavily used daily to support hundreds of remote users. TeamViewer is rock-solid and does the job every time.,Cons: It would be nice to improve the client experience when requesting support from a technician. Perhaps being able to send a link via email to the user would assist the lesser technically capable users.
14,14 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Ryan B.,Support Technician,Computer Hardware,2+ years,4,5,4,4,4,7,“Easy to use but lacking ”,Overall: My overall experience with using teamviewer is the ability to quickly remote into a person's PC along with the automatic two factor authentication that is uses where the user gives you a password and ID to log in. It allows me to quickly remote into software using it quick support and diagnosis problems such as error messages and virus/malware infections. Overall it does it's job well and although it lacks certain useful features such as freeze screens and camera capabilities using a mobile device; it still provides solid use for any technicians that quickly need to remote in and assist their client to get back to 100% performance.,21/5/2020,"Pros: The most impactful feature regarding this product is the ability to assist others who need help and it is free to use as well for personal use. Teamviewer is a remote software that allows you to remote into another person's software in order to help them and troubleshoot any issues they are experiencing, along with transferring files that may aid in helping you fix their issuen Due to it having a free license option you are able to take it for a test run by choosing the option personal (non-commercial) which gives you the basic functionality like remoting into a person's pc and transferring files, if you purchase licenses than you unlock a few more features.","Cons: The least thing I liked about this software was the limitations compared to another software called logmein such as the ability to freeze screens, access certain aspects of a computer without needing to remote in like changing the username and password. And the problems that occur when a customer uses a tablet or phone on wireless networks where it takes forever to load which can be expected but also sometime it never loads. The one thing I don't like is the inability to use a person's camera to see what they see for wiring that logmein (rescueme) can do through lens sessions."
15,15 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Rodrigo M.,Owner,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,9,“Fast and stable”,"Overall: I have been using it since version 5, my micro-enterprise even provides it for use by our third parties who provide support and consultancy to our clients for the management systems we develop. In a decade of use, I can say that I have never been disappointed, it is always available very quickly for us to make a support connection with our customers, including for unmanaged servers and from one country to other. Mobile access makes it easy when you're on travel and need to solve a problem quickly. Despite being expensive by our standards, I can say without a doubt that it pays off every penny spent, I reinforce this by saying that we already do home office and remote service years before this became fashionable. At this point the expensive price teamviewer removes costs the other side of the business.",9/4/2020,Pros: The most interesting feature of the teamviewer is the availability: the connection always works very quickly. Something that does not always remember is that bypass any configuration for firewall and ports and is very easy for any intermediate user understand how to activate and how to pass the ID/password without much explanation.,"Cons: The versions have become more bureaucratic, adding cost and functions that a small company does not need. If you just need efficient casual support, this application starts to be close to the end of the cost-benefit line. There could be a simpler portable version, with only remote access functions for support purposes, without account registration, and therefore cheaper. It is ideal as it is for medium or large companies, but this suggestion would make it easier for micro or small companies."
16,16 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Suzana P.,Marketing Director,Food & Beverages,2+ years,5,5,,5,5,10,“Screen Sharing at its Finest!”,"Overall: Overall, TeamViewer has been a great way to save time when you don't necessarily need someone to come to you to see your computer screen, and can help you remotely. This works for large corporations as well as small businesses. This doesn't have to strictly be used for IT, I am sure it can be used for different sorts of video conferences for everyone working remotely, although I personally have not used it in that way. For IT aspect, it saves you the hassle of having to ""screenshot"" pictures or errors and emailing them all back and forth. It's a timesaver!",30/3/2020,"Pros: TeamViewer software was introduced to me several years ago when I worked for a larger corporate insurance company. Many times, everyone's computer in my department, over 2500 of us, ran automatic updates overnight when we were logged out. This allowed our IT Department to make any changes and maintenance. At that company, when we had issues with our claim software, or phone login, or anything technical, we would report that to our IT Department. They would quickly give us a call, working remotely, and I would accept the TeamViewer request to share the screen. Our IT would have full access to my screen and be able to guide me, or take control, whenever they pleased. Currently, this software works JUST THE SAME for the small family owned business I work for. We recently switched domains, and needed help getting our emails switched over properly without losing all of our mailboxes. This was such an important part of the domain switch. With the help of TeamViewer, our hired IT professional was able to jump in and guide several of us to save back ups and take the next important steps to secure our data.","Cons: Using TeamViewer, I've noticed that sometimes you do experience a ""lag"", but nothing unmanageable. Also, make sure you and whoever is on the other end make it clear on who is running the mouse! That is just a user error, but I've noticed that I would get direction to ""click here"" and when I would go to move the mouse, the person at the other end would be doing the same. Once you give control of your computer, I don't think there is any way to stop the other persons movement until you completely log out. Not like you can put them on pause. Again, this is not a software issue, just something you need to consider if you want a seamless process."
17,17 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Kudakwashe N.,Software Developer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,2,4,5,4,“Remote Desktop Wars”,,13/3/2020,"Pros: What i really don't understand is why would a company develop such a great tool, gets you hooked and then when you and your clients are now familiar and comfortable in using the software then out of the blue, you have to pay to use the software? This doesn't apply to TeamViewer alone, another remote desktop admin app Anydesk did the same thing and recently now the offer buy the business version. At least have the community version with less features than to have timed sessions. But overall it remains the best tool on the market and at least they got the file sharing support perfect unlike Anydesk.",Cons: Great tool but very expensive specially for small companies which have few clients and would want to cut down on cost of travelling to customers site and give technically support.
18,18 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Abraham C.,Active Directory Administrator,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,3,5,5,7,“Pros and Cons of TeamViewer”,"Overall: I was introduced to TeamViewer during the early stages of my career in IT and the software has always delivered when the tough gets going. I've been using TeamViewer now for over 10 years and the current version today has improved immensely since the previous versions. Today, I am fully utilizing almost all the features shipped with TeamViewer from recording sessions during meetings, chat utility, file transfer, audio conferencing, video presentations, etc. It has given me the confidence to perform my duties in the office and outside the office when I am on the go. In addition to the years of experience, I have personalized TeamViewer now as my first choice remote software that I use to manage my own home lab which I can access from anywhere in the world.",26/2/2020,Pros: It's very easy to manage your cloud pcs using this app. I am using this app from last 5-6 years. I am a home user but easily manage my workstation and remote pc from my location. it's very easy to when you are doing work from home.also it's chat msg and voice are very good.,"Cons: The audio conferencing setup and configuration for some users can be an overwhelming experience, especially if the person is not accustomed to configuring software to engage in a conference call. IT support or assistance someone who has better knowledge about TeamViewer may be required in such situations to assist. In some situations I have had to assist end users to configure this feature for them when other audio conferencing platforms fail, and the feedback from the requester is that they have no idea whatsoever on how to proceed with the setup. Perhaps in future TeamViewer may become the go to platform for audio conferencing and chat in regards to other products like Skype and Skype for Business. In my opinion TeamViewer is an awesome tool, why? because it provides the necessary features to improve a person's production when his/her work demands it."
19,19 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,1,5,4,6,"“Powerful and easy to use, but terrible support and extremely expensive.”","Overall: TeamViewer used to be a one-time purchase (albeit and expensive one). While TeamViewer was in this state, I used it frequently to access clients computers remotely. However, the minute TeamViewer changed to a monthly subscription, I stopped using it. The $50/month was simply too expensive when other alternatives became available for less.",20/2/2020,"Pros: I love the functionality and features that TeamViewer offers. I have installed it on different family member's computers so I can remote in and offer them assistance whenever necessary. I can see when their computer is on or off. I can log in when they aren't using it and perform maintenance when necessary. I also love being able to access my home computers, home servers, and laptop wherever I am it. I can even gain access using my cell phone for those ""emergency situations"". Cell phone use is not great, but can get you by in a pinch when someone needs help on something simple. I love the feature set available when you are logged in. Passing key combinations to the remote computer, changing screen resolution, chat, and lots of other items are amazing to have. I like that I can simply disconnect and know that the remote computer will get locked automatically.","Cons: While TeamViewer is free for personal use, any business use requires a $50/month license - which is outrageously expensive compared to other options. One of the most frustrating aspects, during install TeamViewer asks whether it will be used for personal or business purposes. If you select personal, TeamViewer will operate in free mode in perpetuity, however if you accidentally select business, there is now way to revert that to personal. Contacting TeamViewer support is useless, as it can takes days to weeks to hear back from support. Even when paying the $50/month, TeamViewer support is slow to respond, and often times unhelpful in their answers."
20,20 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Arik B.,CEO,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,,4,4,8,“TeamViewer as support tool”,"Overall: We use TeamViewer to support customers by connecting to the customer machine we can sometime do all needed support work without the need to visit the customer, this saves us money on both travel and time, not all customers allow to connect in this way, but the ones who do, also gets better support rate.",4/12/2019,"Pros: We have been using TeamViewer for approximately the last 2 years. If you prefer, you can download a small file that allows a one-time-use to give another individual access to your computer for a specific task. I've called software companies and needed tech support, and I've had them use TeamViewer this way. And when they're done you delete the file and it's off your machine. No account necessary. I also have received support from my outside Tech consultant in this way. If I need something upgraded on the computers that I can't handle, they log into my computer when I sit there and they fix the problem for me. You can also create an account that has more security, uses two-factor verification, tokens, and keep track of multiple computers which you can log into even when they are unattended, as long as you keep TeamViewer running on the other end. As it forces me to log in with a time-sensitive code and authentification program, it feels pretty safe to me, and I've never had a problem. We use QuickBooks, but don't want to pay for the cloud version. So when I need to, I can log into the computer at my office that's running it remotely, and run reports or create entries from home. and you can choose to log in right through the TeamViewer website to a browser, so the other computer is accessible from anywhere. It's saved me in a pinch multiple times, and kept me from having to purchase cloud-based versions of other programs that were beyond my budget.","Cons: The versions issue, we have many version mismatch problems as we buy our side of the software and not the customer side also we often in a situation that the customer has upgraded to new version and we cannot connect with our own version. Upgrades are expensive"
21,21 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Thomas C.,Director,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,4,5,2,9,"“Great software, easy on non-technical users”","Overall: TeamViewer (for 99% of the time) is easy to setup, easy to configure, and easy to use for both myself and my clients. I've been a long term personal user of TeamViewer, and finally wanted to find a solution for work. TeamViewer pricing was kind of expensive, and found cheaper alternatives (AnyDesk). I tried AnyDesk because of its competitive pricing. However, I noticed that it has bugs in terms of requesting the remote computer for administrative credentials. It will just freeze in that screen. When I tried to email the support, they gave me an irresponsible reply, and never managed to fix the issue. At last, I gave up. And I went with the TeamViewer package. More expensive, but worths it.",3/12/2019,"Pros: This software has been very useful to me since it came to market, especially for me, its main function of sharing and controlling desktops remotely, for example, on a personal level to obtain information from my personal computer and manage my LANs. In the same way, one of my jobs was to be Technical Support Analyst Level 1, and one of the applications of this software was to corroborate the tests of the clients that in some other way have already been confused and not that they do not have a good knowledge of the networks. telecommunications. As an IT analyst, he helps me in the remote work with servers, as well as in the transfer of files from PC to PC and to be able to resolve configuration errors and other incidents of the equipment without having to go to the site.","Cons: There are times when it's slow though (with lots of clicks, movements, and keyboard hitting), but those are usually heavy tasks, and it'd be better off doing them locally anyway. Even though I'm doing personal stuff, it claims that I was doing work, and kicks me out of the session. Not sure how they managed to judge that."
22,22 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Emad I.,Senior Web Developer,Machinery,2+ years,4,5,3,5,5,8,“TeamViewer is packed with unique features but at inflated price.”,"Overall: The best overall remote access and desktop sharing software in the market hands down, packed with lots of features that you could barely find in any free or paid alternative, but this all comes in a very restricted free plan and inflated price if you decided to upgrade to paid plans, their prices need to be revised and their cancellation policy need to be reviewed and implemented properly for the best of their customers first.",27/11/2019,Pros: The ease of use and the way it displays the desktop you are remoted to is like having the computer right there with you. The way the mouse moves when remoted is so easy to use. I use this from my smart phone as well as my laptop and both ways are easy. Its pretty straight forward to setup and within minutes you can be connected. The best part is works from all over the world having remoted in from Tunisia and Portugal.,"Cons: I would have given this amazing piece of software the full mark unless it suffers from two basic issues that irritates me a lot and need the company to look for a solution to those problems sooner than later if it wants to keep its loyal customers like me, First and most important one is their pricing plan for paid version, As i mentioned I use the paid version for business but recently the prices has doubled for no apparent reason, and there is no clear cancellation policy on which i can opt out from using this software or change plans to lower one, the customer service need to do more to address this issue and help us by having different options with reasonable price and effective cancellation policy for those who want to change their mind and not get a constant deduction against their will, the Second reason is for the free version for personal use like the one i use in my home, which after latest updates became very messy and disconnect me every 10 seconds with an ambiguous message stating that there is a commercial use detected and a long time out before i regain access and reconnected again and again, I never suffered any such problem like this before, but the free version become very hard to use with this policy which made me sadly revert to less intrusive and more welcoming alternatives, those issues needed to be addressed and resolved ASAP so teamviewer can keep his position as the number one product for remote access of all the time as it once were."
23,23 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,5,5,3,10,“Remote Connection is now made easy with TeamViewer”,Overall: Communication problem using this tool was very much easy and has reduced the cost of the additional IT Infrastructure set up as we get connected to all stake holders and client meetings very easily and flexible and audio and video conferencing is really a wonderful feature are enjoying. This is also available in mobile version as a result we are connecting to our business meetings on the go a fantastic feature i really love,29/9/2019,"Pros: I've used TeamViewer to remotely access both my own computer when I'm away and an office computer when I'm at home. I worked for a sole practitioner lawyer part-time for many years and he would get very frustrated when he couldn't figure something out on his computer, so I'd get a phone call or message, and I'd dial into his computer to fix the problem remotely. Sometimes in the evening he would leave work for me to remotely access up on his computer, and his computer on and not in standby mode, and I would log in and be able to work overnight on the things he'd left me during the day. I could also dial in and see whether he was playing Solitaire on his computer or actually working, as he could be easily distracted. There's file sharing and conferencing ability. And something else that was helpful - I could dial into my home computer and access the camera and see what was going on when I wasn't there. This was very helpful for me in discovering which roommate was stealing from me! The application has to be installed on both computers, so it's not like you use this program to hack other people's computers or anything like that. And there are settings permission controls on the accessed side which allows you to set up whether permission needs to be obtained for each access or if you have full authority. Very versatile and there's probably a lot more I could be doing with it, if I really thought about it, but it's great app and very useful for remote workers.",Cons: There is very least about this software everything is really wonderful. But the least about this software is the program that renders output if we consider like handbrake doesn't consider TeamViewer as a legitimate physical display and these programs show up as black or white rectangles. But another small drawback which I felt is its commercial version is bit costly but even then we can afford as this is giving great benefits like video and audio screen sharing conferences
24,24 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Ho'omana Nathan H.,Research Assistant,Higher Education,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Probably the best multi-platform remote access\support program”,"Overall: This is a great remote desktop solution for both professional and personal use, and the personal version has all the features of the commercial version, so if you'd like to try it out personally first, you have that option! If you're looking for a remote desktop solution besides the (excellent) Windows Remote Desktop Client, this is a great starting place.",18/9/2019,"Pros: Since 2007, I have been using Team Viewer and this solution helped us a lot, particularly when I was working in my previous organization. The simple way of connecting by using an identity and password is really cute. As a business analyst, this tool was helpful when we have to look at existing solutions deployed onsite. Also during enterprise custom solutions delivery, many times, the team can not redeploy the work in progress site, onsite for demo and evaluation purpose and this great tool was of great help to us. Another beauty of the tool is to use as a platform for online meetings particularly when low bandwidth is anticipated. I believe the best part of this solution is ease in setup and highly intuitive interface. We have seen Team Viewer working even with unstable internet connectivity. Liked the way it gets reconnected once the internet is back. Team Viewer may be the best solution for anybody in software and services space to work remotely. So far I have used only on Windows OS but heard about its performance in Linux OS.","Cons: The only major issue I've had is that programs that render directly to an output (e.g. Handbrake) don't see TeamViewer as a legitimate physical display, so those programs will show up as either white or black rectangles. This means that you can't see what's going on in those programs."

This is the only remote access software I have on my PCs. Ive used a variety of remote access programs and TeamViewer is the only one that I can trust to always be operating when I need it. Furthermore, TeamViewer has an incredible user interface; the most impressive operating being their cell phone application through which I can perform moderately complex tasks from a 6-inch screen easily. Lastly, TeamViewer has every feature you can want to remote access. If you want to remote access your cell phone, run TeamViewer off of a USB stick, or create a separate window for each of the remote PCs monitors you can do it. More importantly, user interface allows these functions to be utilized with little to no prior knowledge of the program.","Cons: I have a hard time thinking about something that I do not like about team viewer, however the format in which the videos are recorded would be good to support other formats so it could be compatible with other media players, and not only with team viewer."

I don't remember a time when TeamViewer wasn't able to get the job done!",10/5/2019,"Pros: TeamViewer allows you to take remote control of equipment quickly, easily and efficiently using two types of communication methods. The first consists in taking remote control of a team by means of a dynamic IP and Password assigned by the same TeamViewer, thus guaranteeing a reliable and stable communication between the involved teams. This connection method is highly recommended for a temporary remote control. On the other hand, if a fixed remote control is desired on a team, TeamViewer offers a second method of connection that consists in the creation of an account on the page of this tool, allowing to establish communication with the desired equipment through the login of the user's account With this second method of connection, a fast and practical remote control over equipment that is used constantly is guaranteed. In addition, TeamViewer allows the transfer of files between the involved teams, it also offers the option of transferring quick commands between the teams, which facilitates the user's remote maintenance and support. The installation of TeamViewer is light, does not take up much memory space for all the functions it offers, including administration and backups that can be done between computers.","Cons: The price, it's one of the most expensive software for remote desktop solutions but that's because it's the best, but if you want the best you have to pay for it."
27,27 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Music,2+ years,4,5,,5,5,6,“The Big Hitter of Remote Connection Software”,Overall: TeamViewer has been incredibly easy to use and has enabled the ICT department to provide a high level of support when responding to support queries. It has led to increased productivity as technicians no longer have to leave their desks for every support ticket and has cut down on response times helping us meet SLAs.,7/5/2019,"Pros: Teamviewer's OS agnostic system is about as convenient and reliable as remote access systems come. From 'unattended access', strong (allegedly even NSA-proof) encryption (SNOWDEN leaks) and 2FA through to great bandwidth management, easy installation, wake-on-lan and file transfer functionalities, it is always my go-to tool. The free for non-commercial use is great for home use (but a tad frustrating if it detects commercial use just because you use Windows server at home).","Cons: There have been security concerns in the past year or so that have shaken confidence in the software, however TeamViewer have implemented several fixes to improve security and prevent malicious use (steps such as increasing remote ID length and patching software security holes) to remedy the situation. The pricing is not perhaps as competitive as we would have liked."
28,28 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Laura N.,Member Services Coordinator,Renewables & Environment,2+ years,5,4,,5,5,9,“A necessity for our operations”,"Overall: This has become not just another tool that we use, but an absolute necessity to efficiently operate throughout the course of a day.",22/4/2019,"Pros: My favorite part about TeamViewer is that, it can be run on most of the software and it is incredibly easy to use! We find a lot of features in Team Viewer that isn't found in any of the other similar tools. With Team Viewer, sharing a complete desktop window with another user has been made a seamless task. The file transfer tool has been great in helping us to transfer all types of files. If you are keen on demonstrating something, on the whiteboard you can just draw them and get them highlighted. The application is free to use and you can just join and leave meetings without much hassle. With Team Viewer you can control a desktop device via any portable device! They provide service round the clock, a quick and responsive support team is always a plus.","Cons: The desktop app has had some minor flaws over the past few versions, where it does things like sometimes consistently refuses to connect the first time a connection is attempted, but then always connects on the second try. Sometimes it's a pain having to go to the website and do all of the authentication steps just to change a simple administrator thing. I haven't seen any way to log into multiple devices from the mobile app."
29,29 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Sadaf G.,Sustainability Analyst,Construction,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,9,“One of the better tools for remote support”,"Overall: TeamViewer has helped my team work remotely and had added immense value to our work performance since it was almost unheard of to access a computer from home or site. Now it is indeed possible, all thanks to the remote access capability offered by TeamViewer. At a competitive price which is quite affordable for a medium-sized organization, I love the whole idea of using TeamViewer as I can easily access my files, emails, documents from my work PC, especially when I am at site and urgently need to present something to the Client; it has truly been a help during the most critical of times. As a Consultant who needs to be on site more often than not, it has been a reliable partner to locate my files, documents, diagnose software issues if any, conduct an online meeting and collaborate on tasks as well. I have previously tried a competitor and needless to say, I consider TeamViewer to be the polished one of the lot, with negligible bugs and issues with running the software. Highly recommended tool especially for consultants and businesses.",26/3/2019,"Pros: Team Viewer was easy to install, easy to set up and easy to use. Interface is very user friendly and lets you interact with a remote computer with ease. A lot of features that you can use, such as file transfer and online chat. I would recommend this software to anyone who has the responsibility of maintaining a network of computers.","Cons: Free version users do have restrictions in use wherein they will be unable to try out all features of TeamViewer. This can be a deterrent to actually buying the whole package, considering the need to try out all features before taking the plunge of investing in it. Other than that, there is actually no negative aspect of using this software and I am quite pleased with it."
30,30 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Information Services,2+ years,4,5,5,5,5,9,“An extremely useful program that is simple to install and use”,"Overall: By and large TeamViewer has been an extremely useful program for me, drastically reducing the troubleshooting time frame for a huge number of tickets, and I fully intend to continue to use it into the foreseeable future.",21/1/2019,"Pros: For remote control software, this is awesome. When I first purchased the perpetual business license, I could add as many machines as I wanted. Super easy to install, it's fast to connect and just works.","Cons: From a business perspective where a licence has been brought the only thing I could think about improving would be the allocation of said licence. When logged in a licence is not applied to the computer, instead this has to be done through the management console. Further re-allocating a licence (e.g. a computer is decommissioned and the licence needs to move to the new computer) is also needlessly complex - when I last did this it involved revoking the licence to all computers then re-adding them which seems unnecessary. Also whilst not TeamViewers fault TalkTalk seems to flag it up as dangerous requiring it to be added to the Safe list of the parental controls - unsure if TeamViewer would be able to convince TalkTalk to remove it from this dangerous listing."

We just need to get this program installed on our host as well as admin systems, a password will be automatically generated and we can access the admin system with ease. The best feature is, in fact, the file sharing option. We just need to drag and drop the files in order to share. The best part is that the application promises high levels of security and speed with a comparison to other similar applications. It is very easy to use this application and I didn't have to give extra efforts in training my team. Other than enabling us in getting access to our systems, it has helped us in organizing web conferences and collaborating project well.","Cons: I am very satisfied with your options and capabilities, I can not describe it negatively because it is surprising, only that the commercial options, in terms of prices, could improve, so entrepreneurs can seek to hire other plans more accessible to their financial reality, without neglecting the quality that have reached in this latest version 14."

But if you're not making enough money to break even, this adds into your expenses. A great program and superb support!",26/12/2018,"Pros: TeamViewer is very easy to install and use, which makes it really easy to provide remote support for non-technical people. The file transfer window is great, and it removes one big barrier to software support - providing updates when you're actively troubleshooting. The meeting software is very good too, with good VOIP support, whiteboard, etc. I really like the unattended host mode, which allows me to connect to machines without someone on the other end. I also really like the Quick Support module, which I've included with several of my applications. Makes it very easy to connect with my software customers when they have a problem.","Cons:  1. The remote user must have the same or compatible version. For sometime I had to insist that my remote users have the same version. If not, sharing is not possible. 2. The nature of certain programs do not allow remote use. For example, some clients use Kaspersky. If they need you to do some checks or settings on it, it's not possible. Kaspersky cannot be accessed remotely. But this is not a flaw of TeamViewer. Rather, it's a security feature of Kaspersky. 3. It's not free. But that's understandable considering the features you get. But then again, it's 'quite free' up to some extent. Not for commercial use."
33,33 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Hospitality,2+ years,5,5,5,5,1,10,“Good Platform for manage and remote your cloud pcs”,,30/8/2018,Pros: i have been using this software for debugging issue with customers via desktop sharing and taking control of customer desktop. it works good i can send or receive the files as much size as i wanted and didn't face any issue with respect to file size to be shared till now. Sometime it become slow(desktop sharing) but if you have good internet connection then you might see this issue. it is easy to use also free versions are available. it is secure and sessions are always encrypted.We can add all our computer to our account so we don't need to remember Teamviewer ID's and shows when computers are offline and online. It is also available as an APP( i am using on Android).,Cons: no any point which i don't like about this application.

I'm grateful it is NOT just for Windows. As a Linux user (as well as a Windows user) one huge benefit for me is that TeamViewer has a native Linux implementation. And they have iOS and Android apps. This means I can provide support remotely from any of my computers and even my phone or tablet. (But I'm not a big fan of doing sensitive work from a phone!) Another benefit is the interface: it is so simple that asking the person who is receiving remote support to do anything in it doesn't freak them out. (A calm end-user makes helping them out a much easier undertaking!) TeamViewer offers ""contact management"" but it is not a contact manager in the way we usually think of contact management. When it's time to offer support to long-standing clients (or friends or family) it's nice to have their contact details -- as they relate to accessing their computer -- only a few clicks away. I haven't ever had a need to use the collaboration features for groups -- no group meetings or group chats -- so can't speak to how well those are implemented or whether Teamviewer does a better job than other apps designed for those purposes. Overall, TeamViewer is my go-to solution for remote desktop control.",11/8/2018,"Pros: You are able to assign computers to your login id, making remote access quick and easy as well as secure (multi-factor authentication, can set up passwords to gain remote access, etc). Furthermore, you can record your session, pop out the monitors of the remote computer if you have a similar number of screens, and, lastly, their app is very well made. Regarding the app, the UI is both simple and surprisingly functional. This is the only remote connect app that has allowed me to easily perform tasks on a remote computer. As an extra bonus, there is a TeamViewer quick support app which allows you to access your phone from your computer which is sometimes handy.","Cons: I don't like that I can't remote into a computer behind the scenes. If I am at work and I remote into my home computer, anyone sitting at my desk will see what I am doing. There is no way to hide my actions or work behind a locked screen. I really want the ability to do that when the case calls for it. The software is not easy to setup nor is it intuitive. Make one wrong move and you could end up paying for something you don't really want. The UI is not that great, but once you have it figured out, it's pretty easy to control."

Whether it be fixing an issue, training a user, or transferring files from one machine to another. Teamviewer has it all.","Cons: I don't really see a downside to the program. I remember a year or two ago there were some security concerns, but a lot of this seemed to have to do with how stringent you are in how you choose to allow remote access to your computer. With the two-factor authentification and the use of security tokens, and the proper security settings on TeamViewer on my computer, I think it would be pretty darn difficult for somebody else to gain access to my computer. Just take the extra precautions even if it takes you an extra moment to login, and the peace of mind is worth it."

The application is very easy to use and we can use this application for a variety of purposes. Starting from - Communication between two people to managing your team communication. You don't have to pay for using this application if your purpose is non-commercial. It provides high-quality voice and call transmission. The remote installations are easy and high security is enabled. The next thing I love about team viewer is their support team, they get in touch with us and has helped us with dealing with our issues.","Cons: Among the main disadvantages, I mean not being able to use the application without Internet connection, although it is a purely interactive software, I should try to eliminate that feature because almost always, for example, in my country Venezuela, the Internet tends to have connection problems And they should extend the limit of computers for a session, even if it's just about controlling a single desktop, you can try to resolve many incidents at the same time, for example, for an IT staff and you should have several computers when in some very limited companies ."

38,38 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,9,“Remote Control without hassle”,"Overall: TeamViewer is one of the best - in my opinion THE best - remote software tools available. The free version is incredible and essentially fully functional (at time of this review - although it has been for a long time too). The software works impeccably and is a staple for our use; we recommend it everywhere and many IT support techs we know do likewise. In my experience it has been completely bug-free and an absolute dream to use. I can't recommend this software enough and I can guarantee it WILL NOT disappoint. Thank you, TeamViewer, for a great piece of software! (I do not work for this company and have no affiliation whatsoever - I'm just an IT guy who is sick of crappy tools and values a piece of art like this when he sees it!)",9/12/2018,"Pros: TeamViewer is a great remote desktop (RDP) tool that works well on Mac and Windows. We have used it for some time now and find it to be a great tool for remote desktop management and web conferencing. - TeamViewer is great to remotely log into a desktop anywhere in the world as long as you have the login credentials - TeamViewer has an easy to set up process and you can be logged into a host pc within minutes once you pass the learning curve. All you have to do is enter the credentials of the host PC and you are in. - TeamViewer's web conferencing feature is also great as you can decide which ""side"" is in control of the screen, allowing easier access to both parties. - The chat feature also works great when used in conjunction with the remote desktop feature, especially when training someone or providing support for a specific problem. All in all, TeamViewer is a product that is best for IT support staff and those who do a lot of remote desktop management. It works well for occasional use as well.","Cons: Actually, I can't really say anything negative about it. It does what it's supposed to do, and as I mention above, helpful in unexpected ways as well."

For me as a IT administrator TV is very useful , important software to handling IT related issues, file sharing.",30/10/2018,Pros: Teamviewer is a robust remote control tool for your business. Teamviewer is easy to use and install. Once installed the customer will give you their computer ID and unique pass code. This pass code changes for each session so your customer doesn't have to be concerned with unauthorized access. It is loaded with features. The file transfer feature comes in handy when installing software or drivers. I have used other remote control software in the past with comparable features but the tool bars have a tendency to get in the way. With Teamviewer you can hide these tool bars so they are not in your way. If needed they can be easily accessed. Teamviewer has a free version for personal use. This is very handy when helping family and friends with PC issues.,"Cons: Observed that a series of updates are coming and sometimes get confused with the releases. Probably, a better way of communicating could address this dilemma. Somebody with a basic understanding of remote support tools can use Team Viewer. However ab average use may be utilising10% of features and there is a space for better utilization with much more customer education. Another observation is the pace in file transfer, particularly when we try to upload large files."

This is software that is very user friendly for the users as well as the administrator.  Once we connect to our customer's machine via TeamViewer, the using performance is also excellent. We don't feel much difference, and almost there is a negligible difference in the remote sessions. The options for admin to control the customer system is also very beneficial. We might have thought of buying other software on behalf of TeamViewer, but we went to TeamViewer which is the best decision that we took on selecting the product.",21/9/2020,"Pros: Teamviewer has been of great importance for me and my team. As we mostly have to stay connected through our systems for better coordination and more efficiency in our projects, teamviewer plays a major role in getting our system connected and communicate via call or text. We can easily get connects our system and even provide remote assistance through each other system access. Files and folders are also easily transferred via network between connected systems.","Cons: TeamViewer appears to require a little more processing power than other remote access software's and is bit more expensive.

We have some vendors at work that use TeamViewer to remote assist, and it has always worked seamlessly.","Cons: TeamViewer communication between teams is unstable in case of using the communication method with IP and Dynamic Password, because if communication with the Internet is lost, another password will be created automatically, blocking the previous connection.

Our team members keep traveling a lot due to work and this tool has become an ease for them to share their screens via remote access. With the help of TeamViewer, the team members are able to access PCs of each other through remote access and are able to solve each other's queries and issues. This is a great software which can be used with great ease. Only we have to do is all team members have to install the software and just share the password with the one to whom you want to give remote access to your PC. For example, the team members working on same presentation are able to see the content and give suggestions to each other. This software has also been helpful to our IT person who is able to take remote access of our PC and solve the problems that we are having sometimes related to files and folders or other softwares. The main benefit is that we can access each other's PCs from different locations. Superb software, love it!!","Cons: Cost is becoming increasingly difficult to justify at work. It is disproportionately expensive against other similar tools, the justification seems to be the addition of non-essential recent additions (IT Brain etc.) which to someone who requires just simple remote access through NAT could be considered bloatware. I use the product primarily for its simplicity and convenience but if the price goes up any more I will be forced to trade convenience for a combination of other free methods.

Using a customised support client, which the user can download from our website, we can be on the customer's device and helping them in seconds. Once on, the ability to see all of their screens, upload and download software and maintain full control allows us to support them effectively. For server connections, the ability to have a library of server details saved, so we can connect easily is a huge boon.","Cons: Since I only use it with one or two people (a few times a month), pricing is prohibitive for a home user. Your pricing plans offer quite a bit for a corporate user, not so much for me. As the years went on, more and more of the features disappeared with ""New Versions"" and I have to keep explaining that I am not a ""Commercial User"". If you had a pricing plan that would give the ""occasional"" user a chance to use the software, I would be more than happy to continue with Team Viewer."
45,45 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Elbek K.,Research Assistant,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,4,5,5,7,“TeamViewer Review”,"Overall: I use Teamviewer for academic purposes. Mainly I use my workstations from outside university to do research, run simulations, etc. Despite some glitches or bugs, experience has been good.",30/1/2020,Pros: Product works great and does exactly what it should do. License structure got fixed and makes a lot more sense now compared to two years ago.,"Cons: Like most other software companies, they decided to go to a subscription based model. Even though I renewed my support and upgraded a few times, it's not worth it to me to pay for an annual subscription when there are other options."
46,46 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Julian X.,IT Administrator,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,“Best remote support software ever”,Overall: I am very happy to use Teamviewer as my way to go software for remote control and support software. Definitely suggested.,8/12/2019,"Pros: TeamViewer helps you to remotely access another computer from your own computer. This is useful when doing small troubleshooting activities as well as, for example, connecting a client's printer to a new workstation (for larger office environments). I love that I can perform actions on clients' computers from the comfort of my own home. Gone are the days where I have to drive to a client to set up their email address (my least favourite activity is going to sit in a client's office and have them watch over my shoulder while I work). I like how simple the system is to use - you download it, install it, open it, and send your ID and password details to the person who is going to access your computer and you're done.","Cons: Sometimes when we are doing a transfer of huge files, the speed becomes too low! After using the paid version I had felt that the free version lacks a lot of important features. For doing anything and everything we need a strong internet connection."
47,47 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,IT administrator,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,,5,4,7,“Great support tool for remote clients”,"Overall: This app can really save your business and make user support a bit easier. The only problem is kind of aggresive pricing and licensing which make every older version unusable with the new one. It should be fine, but the clients are usually forced to update every time they run teamviewer on their computers.",1/3/2019,"Pros: You can work with multiple systems. The application is rich in features. You can conduct remote presentations, video conferences, chats incorporating screen sharing and whiteboard tools at a great speed. The service desk integration helps users in the management of their tickets. You can control the remote system and its printers from your mobile. The user interface is very compact and organized. Allows creation of demonstrations and provide interactive training to your team members. You also can check and monitor the health of your machine. The installation and linking process is very simple. It is compatible with almost all devices.","Cons: It's pricey, and can be a little slow at times. The licensing is wishy-washy - I purchased a Business license, but my interface continues to show me as a Free user - but that's more of a quirk than an actual problem. The meeting email template is hard to work with, and often refuses to include the audio conferencing information."
48,48 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Renee C.,Owner,Mental Health Care,2+ years,5,5,,5,4,10,“Great for remote use or tech help”,,15/9/2018,"Pros:  Using this software for debugging issue with customers and technician via desktop sharing and controlling their desktop. Can send or receive the files of bigger size as well as much i wanted and didn't face any issue with respect to file size to be shared till now. Sometime it respond slow while desktop sharing i think this can be easily fix with a high speed internet connection such as in my case it works. Easy to use, available in free versions, secure and sessions are always encrypted.Contacts can be added to our account so we don't need to remember Teamviewer ID's and shows when computers are offline and online. It is also available as an APP( i am using on Android).",Cons: Price is high making it an expensive buy that many companies cannot justify also it is little heavy software in terms of resource usage on your machine as compared to other software in the same category which in turns can make your other task slow running on your machine. otherwise its a good to go with.
49,49 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Research,2+ years,5,5,,5,5,10,“Great Remote Desktop software ”,"Overall: Besides TeamViewer I also used standard remote desktops in Windows and Linux. I would say the Remote Desktop in Windows is still more convenient to use if you need an one-way connection to a single windows machine. Setting up the Linux Remote Desktop was so complicated that I was never able to make it do what I wanted. So I gave up and happily used TeamViewer instead. Thanks to the all COVID restrictions, I had to create a new user on my Linux machine and set up his own TeamViewer remote access to it through my TeamViewer connection. I am impressed with TeamViewer functionality that I was able to do it completely remotely. Finally, if you have some security restrictions in your web network and do not have access to standard Remote Desktop applications, TeamViewer is your choice. It works well through all the firewalls.",25/10/2020,"Pros: The best part of teamviewer is its remote desktop control. This is a great program whether you chose to use it in a professional setting, personal setting, or both. I've used it on a personal level when I need to help my parents with a computer issue or I need someone else to help me. It's so much easier to just fix a parent's computer problem by taking control of their laptop instead of explaining the issue to them over the phone. In the workplace it's great because if I ever need IT support the service center can quickly access my device and remedy the issue. I'll also use the program with co-workers if they aren't in the office so I can show them cool software tricks or help them with other program issues they might be having.","Cons: The price is high making it an expense that many companies cannot justify. Also, TeamViewer is a bit heavier than other products in terms of the computing resources it requires (i.e. requires more of your computer's processing power than other remote connect options which can slow down your other tasks)."
50,50 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Michael R.,Sofware Developer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,9,“it's an excellent software to bring technical support remotely ”,"Overall: It's excellent, simple, easy to install, secure and it doesn't requiere a lot of resources from Computer",6/10/2020,"Pros: The base functionality of conducting a remote desktop session with Teamviewer works great - it does a fine job of handling different internet connections in terms of latency or QoS. For small business, the account feature and the ability to add a few computers to your account for easy access also works well.","Cons: 2FA should be enabled by default. Someone years ago hacked our account and almost did damage to one of our desktop users machines due to lack of 2FA. Thankfully, TeamViewer offers this. Don't make our mistake and be sure to use it!"
51,51 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Ahmed O.,Computer Engineer,Computer Networking,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,10,“Great but need some additions”,Overall: I often use it as a remote admin app to control employees and solve their software issues from my office.,3/8/2020,"Pros: If you are lazy and don't want to come to the office, but all your files and necessary programs are on the office's computer, use TeamViewer. It allows you to connect to another computer under your same account, or if you have the ID and password provided for that computer. It helps a lot if you own several computers and have your files scattered across them. Also helps if you run into some problem on your computer and have to ask a friend for help.","Cons: If you are trying to share bulky files, I tell you this eats up a lot of time and you would end up doing nothing. You need a great internet connection to deal with this application. If you have checked the business application you would find that it is priced quite high in comparison to the other applications available."
52,52 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Michael S.,Sr. Network / Server Administrator,Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,9,“Teamviewer Integrated in ServiceDesk”,Overall: Very solid product with great performance over a LAN or internet.,9/6/2020,"Pros: TeamViewer is an awesome software that facilitates remote control, desktop sharing, and online meetings, web Conferencing as well as file transfer. Another great thing about TeamViewer is that it is available on multiple platforms that means it is NOT just available for Windows but for other operating Platforms like the Macos, Linux, IOS and Android which is huge benefit for someone who operates on multiple cross-platforms. Another thing that I love about this software is that it is available for Free For non-commercial use, makes it possible for me to remote login and offer assistance to my parents occasionally. As a Business Analyst, I think it's an Excellent Tools when it comes to make Conference to clients or presentation to the Company Staff or online Meetings. Also comes handy when you need to Access the System from the clients to troubleshoot simple functionality understanding related problem they have. Speed is great at both when making the remote Access Connection as well when sharing Video, Quality of the video is Also great!!","Cons: it is annoying that an older version cannot control a newer version target PC, the computer that initiate the control needs to have the newer version out of the two."
53,53 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Edward C.,Managing Partner,Computer Networking,2+ years,4,4,,5,5,10,“Teamviewer is a must have for all computer repair professionals.”,Overall: Definitely someone I need for my business and will continuously budget for.,4/12/2019,Pros: This software allows you to connect very simple way to another computers desktop and troubleshoot any problem as well as act like if you're physically in front of that computer.,"Cons: While TeamViewer is generally good overall, there are some flaws about it that you should consider: - Host to Client connection can be very slow at times even when both sides have a fast internet connection. - Losing client connectivity can be an issue as the screen just freezes up and you may not see any indication that there is a connection issue. - If you are using the Personal version of the app, there are limitations on what you can do, and the pricing for a Corporate license doesn't justify itself unless you provide IT support on a full time basis."
54,54 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Financial Services,2+ years,5,3,2,5,5,8,“Best Personal Use Remote Desktop software ”,"Overall: Teamviewer is my top choice for Personal use. it is free and can truly remote control workstations or Android phones from anywhere. However, if you need it for business use, you might want to check around if cost is an issue.",16/11/2019,"Pros: TeamViewer is a remote desktop and remote access software. Its very useful to us as university students when we are doing projects. We can remotely log in to our other members computer and observe and do works on it. We can have TeamViewer account and log into it by the computers we use. So whenever we need to control or use them we can do that if they are power on and online. We can share files directly from TeamViewer we just have to drag and drop from the remote desktop to our desktop. We can chat from the side panel and share our webcam video, audio like as a video conference. We can adjust the video quality as our requirement. Using teamviewer we can host meetings for businesses . TeamViewer can be used cross platform. We can control our PC or Macs using our mobile phone by using TeamViewer App. TeamViewer is End-to- End encrypted so we can ensure our security. We can also use TeamViewer to solve problems on a remote computer. TeamViewer has capability of restarting, Shutting down computers remotely.",Cons: The professional version is expensive. If you are a small company it my not be cost effective to use Teamviewer.
55,55 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“ The best application for remote work”,,20/11/2018,"Pros: This software came to our work environment to stay, and for a very simple reason and that encompasses much of its great value, access and remote assistance. Teamviewer is a high-performance software that allows you to connect two computers and work from the computer you choose to manipulate to the other computer. We use this feature a lot in our work environment when we need to access the equipment of another colleague to transfer files, help repair any software or functions that are misconfigured, do corrective maintenance remotely, all these options without the need to have a technician in person, saving a lot of time and money, using this saving in other activities necessary to maintain our functions in cultural matters at work.","Cons: This tool is really easy to setup , but it also comes with a price of slow deliverance of files and obstruction in the audio quality of the voice call. It consumes lots of time even for sharing files of small volumes. Systems are securely connected but it demands high speed internet for smooth working otherwise it will show lots of problems in the form of video blurred and continuous dropping of call or disconnection of network."
56,56 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Nigel H.,Developer,Health,2+ years,4,5,5,5,5,7,“Used it for all remoting into client and work machines”,"Overall: Generally good, the license has now changed to a monthly. We have multiple users using the same license and obviously only one person at a time using it.",20/8/2020,"Pros: I used to run an automation installation company and Team Viewer ended up being a complete life saver. There was constantly problems with people's system in their home and 9 out of 10 times it was simple user error on their part and could be fixed remotely. Before we started using Team Viewer we would have to send a technician over to the client's house, log onto their computer, and figure out what is wrong with it. It was so convenient when we used Team Viewer because we could just give the client the Team Viewer website to go to, give them a code, and remote into their computer from our office. This saved us so much money on time saved, convenience, and gas money. I also had Team Viewer on my work desktop and so that if there were any documents on it, I had access to them from anywhere I was. There is even an app for Android and IOS that works great in order to remote into your computer. I am very grateful for Team Viewer and would highly recommend it to anybody!!","Cons: Sometimes my personal accounts get flagged as a business. I am not sure why, but it is not the easiest thing to get it overturned."

I also use it to access the servers I have in the office, they are only CPU's without monitor or keyboard or mouse, I enter with Team Viewer and everything is ready!",Cons: The software is good but sometimes it gets automatically disconnected. But it happens rarely so can be neglected.

I would definitely recommend this software for remote accessing and troubleshooting.,23/10/2018,"Pros: Teamviewer allows remote access to another computer located across the room or even across the country. You just need to download the software and share your code with the person you would like to give access to your computer. It works even with mobile platforms, including Windows, IOS, and Android. Teamviewer was easy to use and was accessible whenever you needed it.","Cons: After describing such kindness of the software, I think it is clear that I do not have negative impressions of it. On the contrary, I recommend buying it and use it immediately in your workspaces"

It can sometimes be a pain to get a connection from a customer PC behind a firewall, however you can usually talk the person at the other end through setting it up easily."
60,60 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Aaron D.,Network Administrator,Oil & Energy,2+ years,5,5,4,5,4,10,“TeamViewer ”,"Overall: My overall experience of TeamViewer is extremely great. Other than the Cons, I would give this 90 out of 100. Super easy to use and great options when connected to a remote PC.",8/9/2020,Pros: I am a systems administrator who works on all the platforms. I set up remote installations in various locations around every part of the world. Without teamviewer I can't imagine how I can do all these. I can login to Windows PC and can access a remote Linux PC somewhere in the other part of the world and install complicates tasks like server installations etc.. Some of our database centers are in Europe and I have to do at least 5 installations remotely everyday and I reply on TeamViewer for all this. I have a 50mbps internet connection and so everything works perfectly at this speed.,"Cons:  We wanted to switch to the new license structure but the Support during this switch was with the right intentions but consistently frustrating. Frustrating experiences: - I did not get replies to several Emails. - Replies to Emails were consistently not sent as reply on my Email but as new Email. - Replies were consistently not sent to my address but to other Email addresses not managed by me. - The replies were consistently not addressing me but another person not involved in the conversation consistently (After 5+ contact moments in a couple of weeks) - Agent did not take ownership for decision but blamed his/her boss. - When calling I feel like I have to press sales to get someone on the phone, pressing Support does not get me help."

Its really amazing to get connect to . client computer and show them the demo of our product very easily..Remote Desktop & Web Conferencing was major challenge in our business but when Team viewer came in our scenario, The Major challenge was solved so much easily. This have increased our overall throughput as well as increase in sale.In No Time Setup , We were ready to go .. This is really a innovation to classic remote access.. even now I can access client system from mobile as well in case I am out of office.. So I am always ready to Go.","Cons: Sometimes explaining to people how to use it can be a challenge. But other than that, it's really simple. How I like to explain it to people is ""Send me your ID and password, and then don't touch the computer."" I've experienced that sometimes clients have a small freak out when you say that you're going to be accessing their computer from your own computer - they think it's that their computer is being hacked (what I did hear from one client)."

Besides that the only reason I don't use it in every environment Id been it's the price, there is a reason it is the reference each time you talk about remote support!",30/4/2020,"Pros: The ability to maintain speed on almost non-existent connections, using the quality / performance ratio to the maximum. Its scope is worldwide, it allows remote control on almost any device.",Cons: The team viewer client wouldn't start at times. Default printing options are absent. You can't import bulk files.

I am amazed at the seamlessness to take over someone's PC and remotely repair it. There are very few instances where I cannot do something over Teamviewer. The remote desktops are instantaneous and there are multiple tools to communicate with the end users.,Cons: Price are high comparative to others software in the same category. Heavy software in terms of resource usages and that makes your PC sometimes slow.

Quick easy remote access to servers and pc's from either a desktop/laptop or even a mobile device. We have used TeamViewer since version 6, and it has only got better over time. The feature which impresses me the most is the ease of use when having to remote onto a machine from an iPhone. The mobile application just works, and makes it easy to control a machine from such a small screen.","Cons: No real complaints, I find it fairly straightforward and user friendly. The only con is that if your internet connection or your peers internet connection is poor, the shared screen will be very blurry. This is expected, but it can be frustrating if you're giving a presentation from your computer or trying to get IT help. Also, and this might be obvious, but make sure not to give someone remote access to your desktop that you don't know!"
65,65 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Beth D.,,Writing and Editing,2+ years,5,5,,5,5,10,“Great app with great features”,,31/3/2018,Pros: Team viewer was one of the first remote control applications I used for fixing my families pc's while im away from home. I like that its easy for someone to install it and I can tell someone that is not handy with computers to just go to the website and download the free version. After that I can help them remotely by just getting there ID and password. The ability to get the sound from the remote pc is also great when your troubleshooting sound cards on a oc.,"Cons: Managing a large number of computers is cumbersome. Compared to LogMeIn Central, which I used at a prior employer, it has much less extra functionality - cannot execute remote commands, cannot execute file send/receive without having a popup or slide-in bother the user, cannot see at a glance the status of your entire group."

Disappointing overall.",6/4/2020,"Pros: The main advantage of TeamViewer is that it is able to be used to connect two different computers at the same time and allow them to share files, whether one be running a Microsoft based operating system and the other Linux or iOS (apple). It is also able to be used through mobile devices too. If on the same network, it can allow you to share the same resources without the need for a hardware network, these resources can include printing. It is also free to use if being used for non-commercial reasons.",Cons: Generally the other computer has to be on in order for you to use TeamViewer to access it. There is an option that you can 'wake up' a computer that is sleeping through TeamViewer but it is rather complicated and hard to do. It is a bit inconvenient and a waste of energy to keep a computer constantly on - and so in certain cases TeamViewer won't work

It is really easy to set up an account for all my machines. Once teamviewer is running in the background, one can connect with a unique password without using the temporary passwords offered by default by teamviewer.",29/1/2019,"Pros: The best thing about this software is we can install the client on all new PCs, label them and issue to our users. If they are working remotely, or even if they are on-site, we only have to tell them to open the client and give us the number. There is no requesting permissions to access and we can setup full admin controls. I used it just this morning and it took me less than 15 seconds to be connected to my team member and I had full control, and had their issue resolved and them working again within 90 seconds total. This is valuable in a call center environment!",Cons: This is an excellent software doesn't have much cons but i have been getting these words from around that it's expensive when it comes to Commercial Use though its a great tool effecting many in better way!!

I have used the personal use license to also help out a friend with software troubles and fix it without having to walk them through it and take longer than it would to just do it myself.",29/9/2018,Pros: I like that this software is so easy to use. weather you are connecting to computers on your own network or across the world the image quality and functions all work great. Sharing a one time login to someone to help with a computer issue is easy for even the most basic computer users and the ability to have all of your computers tied to your account in order to log into any of them at anytime is very nice.,Cons: If you don't have a really solid (over 50Mbps) internet connection you will experience some lag and even disconnection to the remote desktop

With that I would use team viewer to log in from home to the computer that was running the instrument to check to see if it was still running. This made it very easy for me to check in on the weekends without having to run into the lab to check. My boss who lived 1.5 hours away from the lab was able to log in as well. I liked that I could have complete control of the computer and could even do some troubleshooting with it when there were issues. I liked that I was able to log in on a computer or a tablet and still have the control that I needed.,Cons: little bit data consuming. sometimes there is a lag in the video and the audio.

It has made my life relaxing.,26/7/2018,"Pros: This software has helped me a lot to establish remote connections both personally and professionally. I have been able to remotely connect to my work computer from my home and facilitate my life when I need some work information, on the other hand when I have requested some technical assistance with a problem with my computer the technician did not have to go to my station work but it connects from where the east and can solve the problem really this software is very practical I just need the code that the same system provides you and ready really has helped us a lot in our office, the accounting system provider that We use it in the office and use it very constantly to solve problems with the system","Cons: We have identified two limitations of this software that prevent us from using its features fluidly. On the one hand we have that when the internet fails, fluctuates or crashes the Teamviewer connection stops working automatically making it a software independent of an internet connection. On the other hand I think that the development department of this software should incorporate the possibility of incorporating more computers to the remote access since we can only establish remote connection with two computers."
71,71 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,YagneshKumar P.,Software Engineer,Hospitality,2+ years,5,5,3,5,5,9,“Teamviewer Amazing Remote Desktop Connection!!”,"Overall: The benefits of using Teamviewer is the security, ability to download Teamviewer across all platforms, the speed and reliability, easy of use, its free, and more importantly its one of the best remote desktop connections out there in the market.

No user training is required. - Combines shared meeting features and remote access features in a single application. - Ability to connect to a remote computer without the need of VPN. (an office computer can be accessed from a home computer without the need of VPN) - Portable version is great! - Supports chat and features like Remote Printing and Wake-on-LAN (WOL),"Cons: If there was a bad connection most likely caused by extremely slow internet, it would cause a pretty big lag. It is difficult to maneuver the clients computer with this lag. I don't think this is Team Viewers fault because this only happened when there was a slow internet connection."

We also use this to mirror screens and present content for training and business communications! Security is great! Our employees love it and aren't worried about receiving support through the app.,"Cons: LAG, LAG, always the LAG, if the clients' connection is not fast we have LAG... . . Of course it's a minor problem for this application, I fully understand the bandwidth usage as we are looking at the other person's full screen. I like the application and this is not a handicap."
73,73 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Jon Y.,Design Engineer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,5,4,3,9,“TeamViewer Review”,"Overall: Overall, we wouldn't be in business without an app like this. We set up web servers for our clients all over the US and being able to remote into their computer to make edits or updates is significantly cheaper than flying out there.",9/5/2019,Pros: I am a little more advanced user and I use this software primarily to help my family and friends with problems they encounter when using a PC. Sometimes something crashed and maybe something is not working right or they need to install something and they don't know how to do it. They just call me and I connect to their computer from my home remotely. I can even start a video call or just voice call with their computer while they are watching me solving their problem. Everything is happening as it would be if I was there. You can even set up remote control of your computer and connect it to your account. This is very handy if you forgot something from your desktop computer at home. You can wake on LAN your computer and connect to it almost instantly from any other computer or even from mobile while you are commuting. Really a must-have software for any more advanced computer literate person.,Cons: Teamviewer had some connections issue from time to time due to network access. It was a bit hard for me to use at first because it was not user friendly due to so many features that most of us don't use or don't understand. They should make it more eye friendly because there are so many things on the screen that we don't understand and there aren't really tips on the software that helps.
74,74 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Thembinkosi D.,Lecturer,Higher Education,2+ years,4,4,3,4,5,9,“Team Viewer for All”,Overall: Teams is user friendly even if you are not a computer guru,14/10/2020,"Pros: There are few teams and organizations nowadays that don't have some of their staff working remotely. This can slow down organizational efforts tremendously without having the right collaborative tools in place. TeamViewer is a basic screen-sharing and remote login tool that allows people to collaborate on the same page (literally) even if they are thousands of miles apart. You can use TeamViewer to administer I.T. support, walk a new salesman through a slide deck, demonstrate the capabilities of software or a website to new users, and other similar tasks. This can save you tremendous amounts of time describing concepts over the phone, or even traveling in person to sites to perform the same tasks you could do remotely via TeamViewer.",Cons: i can tell best about this software but if i have to tell least about is security if someone accessing your computer and you don't know about some functions in your computer he can easily get all your information.that is too risky who know very least about computer or software or something like that.you will handover all your pc to somebody if everything going right its ok other wise some information they can steal

The free personal use product works very well for fundamental things and I find the connectivity is stable and reliable.,9/10/2020,Pros: TeamViewer is my go-to software to access other computers remotely. It's fast and has never let me down in the 2+ years I've used it.,Cons: Nothing as of now to say as a con about TeamViewer. There is not even a single alternate app that does 50% of what TeamViewer does for last 6 years.
76,76 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Gary P.,Data Analyst,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,5,4,5,4,9,“TeamViewer is an excellent remote connection product.”,"Overall: Sincerely, TeamViewer is the best remote connection platform I have used, this product is perfect for me because it fits all my uses, it has allowed me to have a high performance in my work and its availability in mobile applications allows me to connect to my computers from anywhere I am, personally I feel very comfortable with this product and while its operation is excellent, I would never consider changing it for other alternatives.",18/3/2020,"Pros:  What I like the most in teamviewer is that its'the most user-friendly remote access tool that I have ever used. Teamviewer has a great quality on remote sessions, especially over the internet. It is so easy to set up in your pc. Teamviewer makes it so easy to quickly access the computers to troubleshoot issues effectively.","Cons: It would be better if it provides a chat window between the partners, so that it becomes easy to communicate each other. The main drawback in this is, by using ID's and passwords, the system may registers all key-presses and clicks, which in-turn has a chance that our PC may gets hacked."
77,77 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Kieran G.,IT Infrastructure Apprentice,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,5,5,5,9,“I would not survive without Teamviewer”,"Overall: Overall Team Viewer is by far the best remote session software out there at this current moment in time and i highly doubt that any other software will get anywhere near the standard Team Viewer has set. Team Viewer is reliable, accessible and efficient, what more could someone want with a remote session software. Within our company we use this on a day to day basis and i rarely get issues. I even have team viewer installed on my grandparents computers so i can provide them with support when trying to achieve an IT task.",13/12/2019,"Pros: It allows file transfer, offers video chat and voice transmission option and is free. Moreover, it is very secure for sharing files with other users. It is both audio and video through which we can conduct online training. It also allows us to access our data and applications at anytime and anywhere.",Cons: The price is a bit high for entrepreneurs who are starting their venture.
78,78 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Roberto Antonio C.,Senior Software Engineer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,3,5,5,9,“Great for managing remote desktops”,"Overall: When I'm going to provide technical support to a customer, my best option is TeamViewer. It's a well-known software and simple to install; it's great for people who don't know much about technology and need some technical help. It is also advantageous when I want to test how a web application is working on the client-side. I could simulate the screen on my PC, but it is not the same effectiveness. Being able to do this with TeamViewer makes me notice much better the experience my client is having with the service the company is providing.",11/12/2019,"Pros: Teamviewer can be as simple as install, get credentials, support/manage. I've rarely experienced anything outside of that workflow, and Teamviewer app sits quietly in the Tray until it's needed without a hitch. I've had connectivity issues with other solutions, install issues, and setting up native Microsoft Remote Desktop, OS X ARD and some of the open source protocols is high maintenance with port forwarding, scheduled silent launches and launchconfig files.",Cons: I'm not a fan of the file transfer option. The transfer speed seems much slower than the same PC over a VPN and I'm not sure why. I also recently had problems where Teamviewer was prompting me to install beta software of the next major version. The problem with that I cannot connect with users that have a higher major version than I have. I ended up updating my five machines with the beta version in order to connect.
79,79 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Consumer Services,2+ years,5,5,5,4,4,10,“Leading Software in Providing Remote Access ”,"Overall: This product has been the incredible answer for my organization. As I referenced before, we are particularly profited as an organization of remote help, including our supervisors and proprietors of the organization. It is that product that changed our method for working and made us progressively gainful and proficient",11/12/2018,"Pros: I have used this tool for a few years to gain access to client machines and provide support services. It is easy to use and the client is simple enough to walk anyone through sharing access. Another useful feature is the instant meeting tool that allows for screen presentation, whiteboarding as well as the ability to hand-off presenter controls. I have used this on many occasions when impromptu meetings are needed.","Cons: When working within a team and new remote hosts are added to the company, sharing these new machines with other users within the company can be somewhat long winded. There is no automated rule to share new hosts with X Y and Z users, so this has to be actioned manually."
80,80 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Sreekumar J.,Designated Partner,Information Services,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,10,“A relaiable solution to offer remote support and assistance”,,23/7/2018,"Pros: Thanks to TeamViewer, you can instantly support your customers and colleagues. It helps us provide the best quality workflow. The fact that it is an extremely reliable program in terms of security is another advantage to use this program. Every time you open and close the program, it gives a new password. For this reason, the computer you connected to before cannot be reconnected every time. It offers the need to re-share the password mutually, that is, a successful program that is both reliable and equipped.","Cons: Great tool for remote control, and there is not a bad thing I can say about it.The free version is limited to home use and the paid version you get more features like you can customize the client software to with your business name and logo."
81,81 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Public Relations and Communications,2+ years,4,4,,4,4,7,“Amazing remote access app!”,"Overall: TeamViewer is the best app to connect remotely that is available in the market today. It's easy to use and fast and reliable when connected. You don't have to worry about losing connection even in areas with very low network. It's a best app to have especially now that everyone is working from home, you can easily get access to your office PC.",24/8/2020,Pros: We use TeamViewer in our team to gain access to remote computers at various locations without having to travel to the location. It also gives our team the ability to work from home and remote into their work computers. It's a very reliable tool and gives full access to the entire network the PC is connected to. We have also used this tool for virtual presentations and it's come out very successful.,Cons: The only downside to TeamViewer software is that it cannot be used to share very large sized files and it lags Time To Time. It also cannot work if one party is using a proxy.
82,82 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,DARON G.,Senior IT Executive,Market Research,2+ years,4,4,3,4,5,7,“Teamviewer”,"Overall: overall a good experience, billing issues can be frustrating but this is not an issue with the software itself",10/2/2020,Pros: As I am software developer I have many clients which I provide support regularly. I have customers even in foreign country and in order to provide efficient support to all of them I can't be in different places at the same time. But thanks to TeamViewer I don't have such problems. I can assist to all my customers and solve their problems in minutes thanks to remote control feature of TeamViewer. Another great feature of TeamViewer is chatting and video conferencing feature while remote control which makes things done with better results.,Cons: I haven't found many cons besides having to upgrade to newer versions when they improve it for us!

Teamviewer is an excellent support software that considerably reduces distances and allows the establishment of a globalized work platform. In the 21st century, this globalizing element is of utmost importance because it allows to establish a fair competition between different companies and professionals seeking to expose their work and work experience. Teamviewer simply makes part of this goal a reality. Use it, you won't regret it.",24/9/2018,Pros: It is effortless to perform a file transfer or establish a connection to another device. I particularly like the fact that I can group my various devices together or keep them separated from one another. I can also establish a connection from smart phone during times when I am away from my desk - this is an invaluable tool for providing remote support.,Cons: The only drawback of this software is the use of the middle mouse button while using CAD software. Dragging with the middle mouse button to rotate objects does not work. There are keyboard shortcuts for this so it's not a deal breaker but just slightly frustrating.
84,84 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Real Estate,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“Fantastic remote assistance software”,"Overall: Remote support for our agents and their machines.

There is a option called View Maximum, when using that wen can work other PC like ours.","Cons: The problem that I get with this software is that you need a good connection to the internet and the computer usually gets a little more lens than it usually is, this also depends on the bandwidth of the internet you have and that the available options are not so basic and have usage restrictions you should use the paid version"
86,86 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Great remote management software for our help desk”,Overall: We were trying to have an easy way to support our remote users and be able to also support our Mac and mobile device users. We realized that TeamViewer makes it easy to support any of our end users. We have gained time and cost savings in supporting our users and have benefited from quicker issue resolution times since implementing TeamViewer.,28/10/2019,Pros: Teamviewer is fast and easy to use and allows for multiple modes of connection. It's equally as useful to support your grandmother as it is to access your computer from anywhere as it is to connect to your server without worrying about VPNs.

Used often for remote access to servers from mobile devices in off peak times and emergencies. Great product and would advise anyone to pay the extra cost over other solutions.,4/4/2019,"Pros: With TeamViewer one can combine remote access and team meeting in one app. TeamViewer is compatible with all desktop and mobile operating systems Viz Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS, Chrome OS, Blackberry OS etc. TeamViewer is free for non commercial use. I used it a lot in my student days and now at my company we use the paid enterprise app. Security is built into TeamViewer and is the best fit for enterprise customers. The service's multi-monitor support enables display multiple displays on a remote system either one by one or together on a single screen.","Cons: There is nothing special what I did not like about this software but I don't like that if you use this software for commercial purposes that you need to pay a little pricey license. Also if you want to watch videos, movies or play games from remote PC, that is not gonna work as smoothly as you would like to. It is really great for general tasks with a computer but when there is a lot of graphics it tends to slow down things a little."
89,89 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Davidq H.,Senior Accountant,Telecommunications,2+ years,4,5,,4,5,10,“Amazing User Interface”,,9/10/2018,"Pros: I love the wide range of features TeamViewer got to offer. The software has a very appealing layout and very to navigate once you are used to it. This software is very useful as it will can allow remote access to other computer for regular maintenance and help if any error occurs. It as a security function where both users need to agree to the remote access to prevent unwanted access to your computers. Overall, this software has all the functions you need for remote accessing other computers.","Cons: There can be occasional latency issues, and the shared image can occasionally get distorted. However, this is just as likely to be the fault of your internet connection's speed and stability as it is to be an issue with TeamViewer itself."
90,90 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Yaruby M.,Desarrollador Java Junior,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,2,5,5,,“Simple and practical tool for remote control of equipment”,,12/7/2018,"Pros: If you know the connection id and password of the PC you want to connect, you can access it from anywhere you want. Even if that PC is in sleep or logged off mode but still you can configure it to give access when trying to get connect. Best thing I like about it is the file sharing capability. We can share files and documents like we do copying and pasting between the folders in our PC",Cons: It's expensive compared to the competition.

I am also able to help my family and friends with any issues they have on their computers by simply logging into their machine from TeamViewer. This programme has changed the way that I think about computers and their use. Two of my computers, a MacBook and a Linux box, used as media centers, almost never have to be accessed through their physical hardware as I use TeamViewer to do all the administration. I love this programme!",25/5/2018,"Pros: We have used TeamViewer in our call center for the past 5 years. We never had an issue or bad experience. It was easy to use and easy to interact with people on the other side. It makes super easy to explain something to someone at a distance, which you may spend hours on the phone explaining. We use it for training new associates on specific new projects and associated software. Easy to learn using.","Cons: I don't have real complaints aside from the fact that it needs to be updated from time to time because if you don't have the same version with what the customer is using you will not be able to remotely access their computer. But overall, I would recommend Team Viewer because it's very easy to use."
92,92 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Kathryn M.,Office Manager,Construction,2+ years,5,5,,5,5,10,“TeamViewer is my favorite teammate!”,"Overall: TeamViewer has made my life so much easier. I have been using this for over 2 years and there hasnt been a time that it hasn't worked, that I wasn't able to log in to my partner computer and the ease of use is simple from a non technical person stand point.",22/9/2020,Pros: My most liked feature in Team Viewer is that it is ultimate time saver and not location dependent. You can connect to any device around the world and solve the problem in seconds. At work we log in our local system with use usb signer and we often come across with typical problems while signing in. But thanks to Team Viewer our IT staff connects to our computer and solves our problem in a short of time. When the problem is bigger we start audio or video chatting in order to give more details about the problem. Drag and Drop feature is also time saver for installing needed files very quickly.,"Cons: There are some cons such as it can not share huge files and sometimes it lags Time to Time. It needs a fast continuous internet connection which makes it troublesome and frustrating to use. In order to connect the systems, both system should be active and available for use, if the system goes into sleep mode we will not be able to access it."

I work with multiple displays when I code and this application allows me to switch between monitors or use separate windows for each screen. This can not be done using Remote Desktop for Microsoft.","Cons: Teamviewer suffered a security breach a few years ago - consensus was it was poor user passwords, but the fear of giving someone absolute control over your logged-in desktops is enough to give you pause. The simple answer is to enable 2FA across the board. Also, when lining up a remote support session with a client or coworker, the process needs to be way more guided. There's always a bit of hunt and peck over the phone as you guide the client to the remote ID and password. Once it's all solved, things work fine."
94,94 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Patrick D.,Website Editor,Writing and Editing,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Client Support Tool”,Overall: I been using TeamViewer for over 10 years and i use it daily from gaming to website help and it saves me so much time and in turn show who ever i am connected to exactly what it is i am doing so it helps them also in the future to diagnose the issues them selves.

It is real nice to be able to use your phone to double check something when you are in a bind.",Cons: It has the ability to work across platforms and operating systems and that's the best thing about this tool. I can even use the iPhone app to log into my work pc when I am on the go.

It is also a great help for IT professionals to help you out when you have problems with your computer and can't explaim properlly what the issue is.","Cons: One con for me is that a times when the installed versions are different I am unable to make a connection.

I can log onto my desktop at home if I need anything or if I need to log on to anything so my family can use it. At the business end of things, I have used it in my business to talk to clients about different features and help resolve issues that they are having. It's a lot easier to log in remote to their desktop and SEE what is happening and troubleshoot it from there instead of them describing it on the phone or in an e-mail. I have also been a part of a company that uses this software every hour of every day to help with their customer support. With their complex software they are using customers love that they can log in and walk them step by step through the process. They can also record the session and send to the customer so if they have this issue again they can walk through the process. TeamViewer is my choice above any other software.",25/9/2018,Pros: This program makes it so easy for your IT helpdesk to quickly troubleshoot issues on your machine. Just launch TeamViewer and have the helpful computer wizards remote into your computer and get you back up and running.,"Cons: Teamviewer is best in class, but it isn't cheap.

Employees can get into their work machines from home and not contaminate work files with problems and downloads on their personal devices.,1/6/2020,"Pros: If you're traveling for business, and you need access to your work computer from your laptop, this is the software you need! If your connection is solid, there's little to no interference slowing you down, and you can work as if you're right there in the office, using whatever programs you need there. It helps if your connecting to the same type of computer (Macs have different keyboard commands than PCs), but even then this is a godsend. Using TeamViewer also means you don't need to download extensive software from your work computer onto your laptop, which can be a complicated, even stressful process in and of itself.","Cons: The compatibility can be annoying sometimes. We paid for a license for version 11. Unfortunately, Teamviewer constantly brings up ads for upgrading to the newest version. If one of our users upgrades to the new version (the free version), we are unable to connect to their computer remotely because we aren't on the same version. That can be annoying at times."
103,103 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Agnes M.,ICT Engineer,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,3,5,4,10,“Best Tool for Remote Technical Support - Cost and Time saver”,Overall: I like teamviewer and it has helped my company cut on unnecessary travel costs to remote sites. I have been able to assist with remote application rollouts and updates without having to travel to risky sites. Team viewer was so handy when we were doing a baseline survey for M&E using temporary staff and equipment for data collection,19/3/2020,"Pros: TeamViewer allowed me to connect to multiple computers quickly, without having to remember long IP addresses. Just my email and password. It has an intuitive UI which was improved in TV 13. It also allows for remote boot and power off of a machine too, which is very convienient.","Cons: This software is fairly pricey. Also, some of the functions and options are difficult to access and find but once your used to the software, accessing it shouldn't be too much of a problem."
104,104 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Katie J.,Artist,Arts and Crafts,2+ years,4,4,,5,5,10,“Perfect for Everyone”,"Overall: I can help others learn how to use art programs using TeamViewer. My husband has been able to fix others computers without having to go to them or having them load up their computer to bring it here. It is a great program, but like all programs it gets better with time and updates.",10/12/2019,"Pros: Teamviewer is a wonderful tool that will allow you to help remote users without the need to be on the same network. You can provide support from your laptop, desktop or mobile device kind of providing support via MS Remote Assistance but this tool is cross platform so you can view or share your computer or screen from any device Microsoft or Apple, even mobile devices. You can share your screen, transfer files and take complete control of any machine",Cons: You need to have a good data connection to use teamviewer and the remotely accessing PC also should be connected to a network connection
105,105 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Hussein Zaki F.,Senior Technical Consultant/Trainer,Telecommunications,2+ years,4,4,,5,5,9,“TeamViewer Review”,Overall: I have been using TeamViewer for the past 3 years extensively and I enjoy using it as it give me the freedom to help troubleshoot issues with my computers no matter where I am around the world. I am also to carry out any video conferencing session very easily.,14/3/2019,"Pros: Easy to connect using a pin-number that you can give to a client. It's also easy to get a client to connect to your own machine. Connections are faster than some of the others we've tried, and there are options for resolution to make it faster on slower bandwidth connections. File transfer is there.","Cons: No issues at all. Not as widespread as some other software, so sometimes the other side needs to install it specifically, but newer had any issue."
106,106 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Liz B.,Creative Department Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“This is by far my favorite piece of software.”,Overall: I need to connect to a variety of machines in a variety of ways and achieve this through teamviewer. Whether I'm guiding a client through downloading the initializer or accessing an unattended server I know Teamviewer will get the job done.,28/12/2018,Pros: This program is a lifesaver. Maybe not literally but I have almost been screwed by forgetting to upload or start a render or need to access my computer and Teamviewer has prevented me to drive all the way to the office or home. I have used it to help other and it has been used for others to help me. Its mobile version is wonderful too.,Cons: Currently I don't have any concern but I have one suggestion. It would be great if there was auto task feature while doing same actions each time. It would be time saver for support specialists in order to avoid from extra effort. Maybe this feature exists already but I didn't explore it yet.
107,107 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Tarek Y.,VP,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,,3,5,10,“Best B2B Support Software”,Overall: We have tried other remote support products. Nothing is as robust and feature-rich as TeamViewer. Highly recommended.,28/9/2020,Pros: Features. You can interact with everything on the clients computer with no issues. You can paste files right onto their desktops. You can modify performance and see backgrounds if needed. You can use the host to have full time double-click access to any computer it is installed on. The deployable quicksupport tool for others is outstanding as well.,Cons: I didn't find any Cons for this application. I have used this application on a daily basis to connect to my office PC to work. Only problem I have faced is the screen reducing quality automatically due to connection problems. But that's not a major issue.
108,108 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,3,4,5,9,“Teamviewer as the remote control software”,"Overall: TeamViewer made our job easier, especially during this coronavirus outbreak. It helped my IT help desk team fix my computer and besides they showed how to deal with any technical problem.",26/4/2020,"Pros: The Pros list is large according what this software do. Setup, easy to use, variety of version according Operating Systems and, particulary, I like ""lite version"" that is used for only get remote support.","Cons: It is a fairly complete software, it will allow remote assistance to be more efficient and you will always have the option of making meetings or simple conversations in lines that allow you to better know a particular issue or problem. I have no negative reviews towards Team VIewer."
109,109 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Ross Y.,PM,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“Best remote SW I've ever used”,"Overall: I mostly use TeamViewer to help my parents with their computer. Works flawlessly every time. Recently also started using it on my phone - it works great! I've tried a few others just out of curiosity, including LogMeIn, and TeamViewer beats them all hands down.",10/4/2020,"Pros: video calling, screen sharing, talking, document sharing. It can be introduced on any working framework. Primary concern is security, where time to time new secret word can be produced when we need to work with the remote work area, this will be help for the corporate individuals when they are endeavoring to telecommute. Easy to understand, simple to utilize, strong and a best programming or instrument to chip away at with.","Cons: Secure installation must be done on a per-machine basis. .msi installation file is sold as an add-on service, which would be extremely beneficial in domain environments. The recent interface update is clunky and is more difficult than the previous version."
110,110 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,3,5,5,10,“TeamViewer”,"Overall: I have used TeamViewer now for 8+ years. With my Business license I am allowed to connect without any restrictions to any computer in the world that is running the Team Viewer client software (and to which I have been given the TeamViewer ID and password). I use it to connect to end-user computers, servers, etc. I have never tried the relatively new option to use TeamViewer to connect to an iPhone, iPad, or other device.",3/12/2019,"Pros: I love how many platforms they're available on. They have a surprisingly usable and useful iOS app. They even have a good Linux version. The file sharing operation is very easy and good. I don't even know how they pulled this off, but you can reboot the remote computer and TeamViewer will reconnect you when it restarts.","Cons: When it's not working it is really frustrating. Sometimes, all you can do is reboot the host computer. It's a huge issue when the entire point of it is to help assist someone who is not computer savvy."
111,111 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,David S.,Tech,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,,5,5,8,“Works very well for remonte support”,Overall: I've used it for years. Mostly to support people calling me for tech support. Works great!,5/10/2019,Pros: TeamViewer was the perfect tool for me to use for a support program. The program ran in 300+ retail locations across Canada. We were able to customize the deployment and tailor the environment to suit the changing needs of the program.,Cons: When you connect with other computer then your computer gonna be lagging too much. Its only for 2 minutes. Even some bad people hack your data from your computer . So you need to careful about your IP address. Without reason don't give any one your IP address.
112,112 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Francess P.,Provisioning Engineer,Telecommunications,2+ years,4,5,5,5,5,6,“Used to be our No. 1”,"Overall: Whenever we are outside or on field and we need to change settings in specific systems, TeamViewer helps us to remote our PCs in the office and perform what we need to so. It a big help since we can see real time what we need to check or troubleshoot. TeamViewer is very good, if you'll buy the premium, it could be great. You can use it for meetings too But for now, we have to switch to a different product to suffice our needs.",19/8/2019,Pros: Ease of install and configuring makes Teamviewer simple to put on a desktop or server for management and monitoring. We like being able to get into a machine remotely when someone has issues or to watch their screen to see how their workflow could be improved.,"Cons: There is a big delay between what is happening in your computer screen and what is happening in your smartphone screen, wich makes it complicated to do delicate work in some software."
113,113 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Alberto N.,Syste Engineer,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“One of the best Help Desk support solution”,"Overall: I used it daily at my work combined with other helpdesk solutions and is good for me, I can help my colleagues, friends, and family from my computer or my phone to solve their problems with any device that they have, and I enjoy that because I love to help.",19/3/2019,"Pros: I love this software. In fact, as I write this, I am also working on another computer remotely. I use it to fix my Mom's laptop from across the country. Very easy to use and really gets the job done. If you need to remote into another computer, this is the one to use. Works from my iPhone.","Cons: Software has been improving on every new version, new features are been added. At this time no recommendations, just continue listening to customers."
114,114 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,2,5,5,8,“This program is a life-saver”,"Overall: As a remote worker, this program makes literally every part of my day easier when collaborating with clients and coworkers. Rather than tell people things, I can show them. And what's easier than that? I was also able to easily send and receive files during video conferences. Furthermore, the IT health of my laptop and PC have never been better because problems are so quickly and easily diagnosed by IT staff with TeamViewer.",6/12/2018,Pros: We use TeamViewer pretty much daily to troubleshoot the machines in our office. Even when working remotely the connection is always steady and there is minimal lag. We've had absolutely no issues with security and it has expedited the process of solving basic tech problems with both Windows and Mac computers.,"Cons: The price tag is not small. I've used both the free and corporate/paid version of the software the support seemed lacking for the paid version and is non-existent for free users. I understand support is not cheap but the price tag seems high enough where there should be some sort of support improvement. On top of that, they advertise some of their own crap when opening the app even on the paid version."
115,115 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Peter N.,IT Support Assistant,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“TeamViewer Review”,Overall: Team viewer has saved me both time and money. I have helped both my friends and families. Team viewer is easy to use and reliable for remote desk connections.,13/11/2018,"Pros: This software is a great tool if you need to share you screen with a client or another office. You can take control, with permission, of the host computer and navigate as needed. It simplifies screen sharing but also if you need to work remotely. I use this software versus remote desktop connection almost 100% of the time because of the ease of use.",Cons: Definitely go for the paid version! It is so worth it. We tried using the free version but you are limited by time and also by how many connections you can establish. You don't want your IT folks to time out on you while they are fixing your computer and then not be able to come back and help you.
116,116 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Scott J.,Senior Systems Administrator,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Tough Application to beat”,Overall: This is my favorite remote control application. I thoroughly enjoy using it and have for many years. We use it for remote support at work and i use it at home too for my personal systems. It is robust and complete. You cannot go wrong with a purchase of teamviewer for your business.,7/11/2018,"Pros: Ease of use is definitely up there The ability to customize your 'Desktop' connections and provide User Friendly names How easy it is to provide a support representative your ID and password so they can take over your machine The ability to remote control an Android device (phone or set top box) How it shows you the status of machines you have setup for remote control (whether updates are required, etc.)","Cons: There's quite a bit of coordination involved when using TeamViewer, meaning you need to ensure the computer you're connecting to is left on and that you write down or take a picture of the code you need to access it. You also won't be able to connect to the computer you want to access to if the power goes out, but that isn't really TeamViewer's fault---you'll just need someone at that end to open TeamViewer for you."
117,117 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Jonathan S.,"Senior Director, International Technical Engineering",Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,,5,5,10,“High performance at a high cost”,,10/10/2018,Pros: Teamviewer allowed me to keep my laptop at work for years. When working from home and in the evenings I would just use my other laptop or tablet to get into my work laptop to get into email and view websites that needed a VPN connection to get into. It saved my back and would allow me to reduce the risk on getting to the office on Monday and realizing that I left my laptop at home since I had it over the weekend. Then I have elderly parents and a nontech savvy brother and I use Teamviewer to login to their computers when they have issues as doing over the phone support to them would take a great deal of time. So thank you TeamViewer for all that you have done.,"Cons: It has a little more latency on low bandwith internet connections. In this aspect, RDP is superior to TeamViewer. Its Android app could do with some work. It was significantly slower compared to its iOS counterpart on the same Wi-Fi connection."
118,118 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Priya G.,Digital Marketing Analyst,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,4,4,10,“A software with full of mutiple features and functionalities”,Overall: Overall I had a great experience with teamviewer.,7/10/2018,Pros: TeamViewer is a charm. Just install and you're good to go. I loved the unattended feature that allows you to set a password to login to your managed systems without use intervention. It's very useful for those times you need to access someone's system at night from out of town for example. It's by far the best remote access solution I've come across.,Cons: so far I have not had any issue with the product
119,119 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Nicole T.,General Manager,Unspecified,2+ years,5,3,3,5,5,8,“Access all of your locations remotely with ease”,Overall: Makes my job easier - I don't have to wait for other team members to email me documents or reports - I can access all my locations easily from any of my devices. Relatively straight forward for my team members that are not very tech-savvy while still having features for the advanced user.,14/7/2018,Pros: TeamViewer help to share your system with other user and can make the meeting with other user and can share your application or any other work with other user. the other user can also use your system while you are share your system.,"Cons: If you need more than 3 simulatenous sessions, the costs go way up. We have a team of more than 3 techs, so we need something more. Also, there's no real back-end management features as in some of the other softwares."
120,120 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Julie R.,Asst. Accreditation Manager,Law Enforcement,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,“Superb remote access tool that made my office literally anywhere I happened to be”,"Overall: Remote access saves a tremendous amount of time driving from place to place, plus I can connect with people out of my general area, out of state, or even out of country and it is like we are all right in the room!",8/8/2017,Pros: We use this software for many purposes including monitoring computers and also android tablets. This software is incredibly important for us to maintain those tablets for our clients. Without TV we would have to physically appear at each clients office to repair issues. Can't do business without it!!!!,"Cons: I can't really say too much bad about the product. The install can be a little hard to explain over the phone when trying to get non ""tech savvy"" users to install and allow access to others."
121,121 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Julien G.,RSI,Accounting,2+ years,4,5,3,4,5,7,“Good product and features but more expansive in time”,Overall: I used this product from more 7 years and I like speed and reliability.,5/10/2020,Pros: Every feature they market works as advertised and is very simple to set up. i remote into multiple pcs via teamviewer and it is a very seamless experience. I would definitely recommend for both personal and business use.,Cons: Apple support. This is probably not an issue with TeamViewer but instead Apple. Either way viewing the screen for an Apple device is difficult (if not impossible.)
122,122 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Jeff J.,Business Manager,Broadcast Media,2+ years,5,5,,5,5,10,"“Quick, effective, intuitive, and predictable”","Overall: A freak power surge happened during the holidays that affected two server drives, which are physically firewalled from online access. TeamViewer worked perfectly in conjunction with our internal ""remote view"" hardware so that our Vendor support staff could remotely ""direct"" the server rebuild effort. TeamViewer was a lifesaver!",9/1/2020,"Pros: Very easy to use, both user and administrator. It allows you to create your own interface with a built-in password - the user does not have to install anything but run one file. In a very simple way you can also transfer files and the application is also safe","Cons: This software is more expensive than others that offers similar features. Despite having a free version, they should release it a little more for commercial use with a daily limit of connections and not for time in a connection. Sometimes, it only allows 5 minutes of connection, time in which it is not possible to give a help support."
123,123 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Internet,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,9,“Excellent remote assistance tool”,"Overall: I have been using it for years and there is a good reason why I have stuck with it. It is rock solid, dependable and reliable. I genuinely love it.",22/5/2019,"Pros: It has a really easy UI and is very quick to setup. You can very easily connect to a colleague's computer, and the speed/performance of the actions are very comfortable regardless of your internet connection. I also liked the feature that you can control what the other party sees in your local computer, so you can limit their actions to a single window if you wanted. I would definitely recommend Teamviewer not only for personal use and support for friends & family, but as a business solution for large scale remote connections.",Cons: For the amateurs when we see the product we will feel as it is straightforward yet some direction is required. When we free the association with the remote work area we cannot access with a similar secret word again the new watchword will be created. Substantial documents can't be sent. The same number of adaptations are getting refreshed rules ought to be additionally given to get to the new highlights and updates that are going ahead in that product.
124,124 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Sanchita A.,Software Engineer,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,5,4,5,3,9,“Remote access with a great collaboration features.”,Overall: TeamViewer is the biggest name under the remote access. As it comes with the a lot of enterprise level features like Service Queue where an employ can be assigned to the customer with maintaining the auto assign session. The company logo can be embedded with the client session which enhanced the user experience.,31/3/2019,"Pros: If you want to have access to multiple machines with ease, forgetting the operating system, Teamviewer is the way to go. It gives businesses the ability to manage multiple computers for the IT teams. Teamviewer is also perfect for the individual who needs to remote into their computer at home for some files or remote into mom's computer to fix her email.","Cons: The toolbars when you're connected to the remote computers feel obtrusive, although there's probably no getting around that. You may have to tweak your system settings so that if your computer sleeps, it's still connected to teamviewer and the internet (maybe not TeamViewer's fault). It helps to make a note of each computer's ID and password even if you stay logged in."
125,125 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,James T.,Interactive Developer,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,8,“Excellent remote desktop software”,"Overall: I used TeamViewer on a nearly daily basis for about 3 years at a company doing experiential media and design. I would use TeamViewer to remote into our various clients installations and either update or maintain software. I once used TeamViewer to remote run a calibration software on a multi-projector setup in NYC from Green Bay, WI and it worked great.",21/1/2019,"Pros: The ability to remote into a node that is miles away to troubleshoot and make changes without a costly truck roll proves to be very valuable and being resolve problems with remote connection saves time and money, not to mention the application has free service.",Cons: It would have been great if we could capture the login details of a user and apply them automatically when units completed a reboot. The ability to select all units assigned to a group and remove/delete them would have been very helpful as well.
126,126 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Gabrielle A.,Student,Research,2+ years,4,4,4,5,5,8,“Time saver!”,"Overall: Its been a great tool for me! Not only has is minimized response times, but it has allowed me to understand what is happening on the other end because I am able to see it first hand. I would definitely recommend the use of TeamViewer, especially as a means of liaising with academic colleagues and advisers.",1/12/2018,"Pros: TeamViewer without any doubt is the one and only application that allows remote control over all the platforms. It even has a Linux based client application which makes it easier to connect even to high end servers remotely. We explained initial project steps to our new team at another location through a video conference together with TeamViewer. While the both sides video is playing live, we used the conference room PC to control the projector and play slides rather than just screen sharing. The team said it was just like a physical meeting they had at their office. That's the power of TeamViewer.","Cons: Sometimes our IP blocking scheme tags Teamviewer when they change their datacenters. Since they seem to use a lot of outside-the-US services, we have a time keeping up with shifting IP and the master server being blocked."
127,127 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Real Estate,2+ years,5,4,5,5,1,5,"“Really good, but is it the best?”","Overall: Overall, TeamViewer is a great product. It performed well a majority of the time. It ran smoothly and I was able to perform my job perfectly while working remotely. If you choose to use TeamViewer, I believe you will be happy with it.",10/10/2018,Pros: TeamViewer helps us achieve our recruitment goals by easily assess applicant's computer properties and internet connection since we can see and remotekly access their deskop which is one of the major qualification needed from our applicants. Our technical team can also easily troubleshoot system problems that our agents encounter with the software that they use at work with the remote control feature.,"Cons: I almost can't say anything bad about this other than if you get a paid license it is expensive. And always saying it is for personal use even if it's not, but 99.9% of the time, it probably is."
128,128 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,3,5,5,8,“Reliable software for Remote Access”,Overall: In my job field there are many incident happened when I need to access my office computer due to some urgency of work requirement after office hours. So using Team viewer I was able to access my office computer and had done my work. It is very easy to use and very reliable software to do so. Till now I never experienced that Team viewer has been crashed due to some problems like other softwares. So I find it very reliable for my personal use. Though file transfer for big size files are not so good but I do need that option very often so I am ok with that. Overall very good experience with Team Viewer,15/8/2018,"Pros: TeamViewer is the most trusted remote control software! I love that it offers free for personal use, and there's no expiry to it. I'm also happy that the remote connection is excellent, it's almost as good as remote desktop connection within the same network. I also like that it has a feature to gather computers in the same account, so you can save the connections and use them with a click. It makes regular support convenient. You don't need VPN to do the remote connection, you can do it anywhere.","Cons: We've had a few crashes while attempting to connect to host machines but they've been infrequent enough that it's not a hude problem. Also, the user interface could use a modern redesign."
129,129 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,8,"“Works great, but sometimes brings surprises”",Overall: I got cross-platform piece of software that allowed my to control our remote server meeting our corporate standards,29/7/2018,"Pros: I love how fast the remote control, file transfer and connectivity is.

Computer problems, system crashes, and device malfunctions can cause business to stop. Instead of wasting time and increasing costs by providing on-site service for IT professionals, it is much more logical to prefer remote support to their customers using TeamViewer. I think this is the best part.",Cons: The paid version is kind of pricey but there are lots of great features in the free (non-commercial) version
133,133 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Verified Reviewer,,Law Practice,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,9,“Top Enterprise/Corporate Remote Support Tool”,"Overall: Teamviewer is the most feature rich remote support tool our company has ever used.

It is accessible anywhere.",Cons: If you are using your system with other user with TeamViewer you must know other user can do anything on your system and can do any kind of changes in your system. It can fully access on your system so it is big cons with TeamViewer.

I like it a lot. I use TeamViewer for personal purposes only. Once I encountered a problem on my computer and knocked on my friend, he tried to help me with his words but still could not solve my computer problem, he asked me to install TeamViewer and solve my problem very easily. In my business , computer are always connected to the Internet, I can easily control my computer from anywhere with TeamViewer. I also solve many problem of my family and friends by using Quick Support and sharing my screen on mobile.",7/2/2020,Pros: TeamViewer is not a regular remote connection desktop service it is much more than that.

I like the software and I have no problem using it so far.,8/1/2020,Pros: TeamViewer is a very easy to install application on any machine. It's use is super easy with just entering the user ID and password of the machine you want to connect to and in moments you have the access to the other machine.

So I found an alternative ConnectWise Control. Has more features built-in w/out extra per month costs. Teamviewer on the other hand automatically renewed the yearly subscription... Even though I didn't want it. Granted I was less than 28 days to renewal and they wouldn't cancel.

You can switch easily between users screens. I also like the file sharing capability.,"Cons: Once the teamviewer is closed, it shows the teamviewer window in the screen.

You don't need to read the manual to go through it the first time you try it so, that itself sums up pretty well how I feel about the software itself.","Cons: I would like the remote connection to be improved, since the quality it offers on mobile devices is very bad, and it is very difficult to offer remote support through this very bad mobility.

What makes TeamViewer so great is that it's a very easy way for workers to access their work computers from home when not in the office. Using a VPN is a great alternative for this, but because TeamViewer is so easy to understand, most employees default to it instead.

Adding all PC with alias is good to get all sorted. Option to use as private use on several PC or for business purpose with license.

It's great to be able to do this without getting up.I think the unrivaled application in the field of remote connectivity and support.,"Cons: This application lags in transfer speed as it is very low even you have fast connections. The most important problem is if you want to use it to the fullest, you must purchase it which is a little bit high!! It also has some problems regarding its security, Log ins, adding registrations, switching screens, and many more. It does not accept lower bandwidth and in addition execution of scripts is also not good. It doesn't work on proxy servers and in addition, sometimes it gets freezes at times."

Its features and unexceptional and doesn't compromise on its quality. The software provides the basic features for free which is a great deal for an individual. However, a paid version is made available which is quite reasonable. It provides fast connection and reliable desktop connection with the encrypted mode. Plus provides the file sharing feature too. So, whenever your colleague, friends, and family is in need of your help while computing, it makes sure you'll always be there. TeamViewer provides its app on a wide variety of platforms like Windows, Mac, Android, and IOS.",Cons: We have been using our licensed version since 2013 and the trial before that.

I have used them to access personal computers and also for business, so this is one review I feel the most qualified to write. What I will say about Teamviewer is that it is expensive (free version is great, but has limited LEGAL use - thanks for trusting your customers, TeamViewer). If you can handle the large upfront fee, great, but it wasn't practical for me when I needed to finally invest in a solution. With that said, I will also say that TeamViewer has bee the most reliable solution I have worked on. It runs almost flawlessly, is rarely interrupted, doesn't lag, even on slower internet connections, and runs quietly in the background, always prepared to be used. And depending on how you are using it, that is potentially invaluable. As an accountant, I have had to access client desktops to help remote clients with training, troubleshooting, etc. Reliable software makes a great impact on customer service! TeamViewer ensures your customer service will rock and it has great options to choose between unattended access or requiring end-user permission, so clients can feel safe that you are accessing their computer only with their consent. Overall, I would recommend team viewer free for personal use and teamviewer business for business use if you can handle the large up-front (but one time, I believe) fee.",11/11/2016,Pros: We used this in a tech support center serving ISP customers. It made it much easier to work with people in a timely manner versus having to verbally walk them through something. Having the ability to leave a client on the customer's machine also let it be used by our MSP team. The manager functions for reviewing team members were nice but not wide ranging.,"Cons: When user dont have the same version of you, sometime you cannot take the user computer, you need to upgrade your version."

It's an easy way for the support specialists to gain control of our PC so they can troubleshoot the PC,"Cons: Adding several PCs to your account although they are used once a month or rarely might cause you account to be pushed toward a license for business use. I suppose they have to check the usage rather then number of PCs - I might have 5-6 PCs in my account and use them 10 times a year for about 3-5 min sessions, on the other hand I can have 1-2 PCs in my account and use them daily for several hours as a support or something else business related."

Our CRM software costs a lot of money for each installation and I don't like to pay to install it on computers that aren't used every day. By using TeamViewer, I am able to manage workflow and project scheduling even while travelling by accessing my office computer using my laptop, or, although it is awkward, I can even use the TeamViewer app on my phone in an emergency.","Cons: None as of such.

Whenever an issue appears, wherever it happens, thanks to this tool I manage to be there to solve it. This means happy clients, and happy me :) for being effective and sparing a lot of time.",Cons: A relatively new feature of blocking connections from an unknown machine is a great idea but the implementation leaves a bit to be desired. It takes multiple connections from a single machine to authorise connection. Cost for SME's is very high for limited use. A pricing model based on number of uses rather than administrator users would be good. In some cases it may not be used for months and then needed quickly for a few minutes only.

I could see this becoming a problem if you are working with multiple customers offering the software to their consulting partners. That said, there has been a major upgrade recently and I haven't experience the problem since then. So, maybe it has been resolved? The price is a little bit on a high end, but it might be worthwhile if you are using it on a daily basis. I personally have used the enterprise version when I worked with a customer and will definitely use the free version to help out my extended family with their computer problems from time to time."

For this purpose, the app works well.

I use it daily to help my remote team with training and other tasks that require a great deal of detail when executing. Team viewer is also great when giving demos to potential clients via screen share, just generate a link and have the client click on it and tun into your demo in real time. It's extremely stable as well, not much lag and audio is crisp. I would recommend to CTOs and Sales people all day to close deals and manage remote teams.","Cons: The full screen option doesn't cover the full screen, which makes the resolution smaller.

It is a very easy to use program with a ton of great features. Logging into a computer remotely is easy, whether you are allowing someone onto your system or logging into one of your own computers. The ability to create a password for your own use (after signing up for a free account) is great for logging into work from home, while still being able to keep your system secure by giving tech support or other users a randomly generated password that resets every time the app is opened. The mobile app is nice, and the whole thing works flawlessly. Without the need for entering IP addresses and port forwarding, Teamviewer is a simple program that anyone can use.",18/1/2016,"Pros: I use a different type of tech support software to connect to my users, but Team Viewer is great if I have issues with connection.

The facility is also super important and helps in the general presumption of the program, in short it is an excellent program and even helps remote support.",Cons: The only con I can think about is just making sure that you don't give out your password or ID to the computer unless you trust the user.

The option to send local files to the remote computer (like drivers or share a couple videos) was awesome. But, like I said, suddenly it stoped working insisting on that I have to buy their license because their AI algorithm thought i was using it for commercial use. That's really disappointing, couldn't reach for any kind of support that could solve the issue in an easy way (they suggest that I should download a form, fill it, sign it and upload it for someone to review it and restore my access, which sounds pretty bureaucratic since it took me and my friend about 2 minutes to get google remote working for both). So, in short, expensive, unclear rules and lack of realtime support. It was great, but this year it went to the bottom of our list.",17/9/2020,"Pros: I have got acquainted with TimeViewer some months ago through my friend and the IT person of the company that I work for. There was a problem on my outlook emails. So, I could not receive and send emails. Or I received emails one or two days later.

The developers did a good job keeping the ""engine"" separate from the sleek streamlined UI everyone has come to appreciate. It wastes no time looking pretty. Don't get me wrong, TeamViewer is supposed to be a remote access tool and it does just that. Rather splendidly if you ask me. I love that the whole user experience is centered around being functional as opposed to looking unnecessarily good. One neat feature is the disabling (or hiding) of graphics like desktop background to make way for a more stable connection. Kudos!",Cons: I just can't think of any cons.

856,856 TeamViewer,TeamViewer,Manish A.,VP,Telecommunications,2+ years,4,4,,5,,5,“Time to wakeup”,"Overall: Teamviewer should realise that they are NOT having monoply in the market now and they should make free version which can be bonded with email id or any other id so that user should know for how much long he can use the teamviewer and either he should packup the stuff before time over or buy topup to continue the session. As of now, teamviewer treats us like a slave and cuts the connection as and when required. And that's the reason of acceptance of new entrants in the market. In my personal view, teamviewer should concentrate on the freemium customers as the probability of moving from freemium to premium is very high. No one would like to buy a car which has excellent pickup and features but with no fuel meter. No one wants to be kicked out without any reasons.. Thanks",15/4/2019,"Pros: This application simplifies the hiring manager work, I love the accessibility and great service.

It comes handy when one cannot be present locally. As long as there is a stable network connection teamviewer will work. Also in many industries some companies currently use it for technical support in order to view the end users computer and have access to their screen so they can see what is going on and help them resolve issues. This is probably one of the best features I can think of as when I was having issues with one of the product we buy from a company, their tech support were able to help me resolve by being able to view what is going on my screen. It is a very secure platform as it requires multiple layers of connections and authorizations before being able to connect remotely.","Cons: It is expensive to use and their license is expensive too as the company has to renew their license every year to be able to use it. Also in my experience while using this platform there were multiple disconnections and connection issues at the beginning. I think it needs to be much more well integrated in terms of chatting, file sharing and multiple connection hosting. Minor glitches on the internet has caused my connection to crash many times or audio to not work properly. I have learnt that having different version of the team viewer for the same connection generates some issues as well which in my opinion should not be the case for a proper integrated sharing platform."

There were 3 things in particular that did not make too much sense. The first thing was mass deployments. This was almost impossible because every deployment required the deployment to be accepted on the email account associated with the product. The second issue was getting the MSI package to work. We could not figure it out. The third issue was when we got a couple MSI deployments, we had to enroll the user into our group, which was counterproductive because we can just go down and use the URL and have it done in one go, which is what we did instead of deployment."

It helps that happen quickly and easily. It's faster than taking over someone's screen from Microsoft Teams,"Cons: We only use it for the one function, to my knowledge, but plenty of alternatives exist. If Teams were a bit faster when taking over another person's system, I don't think there would be any need for TeamViewer. It would be nice to do everything from one app, rather than have to be on the phone with IT and manage this separately. Small gripe to have though"

Our plan auto renewed during the coronavirus shutdown and some of us weren't working. We wanted to cancel the membership and reached out to customer support to cancel and get a prorated refund. However, we were told that due to their terms of agreement they don't issue refunds. I then emailed and explained the circumstances and let them know the renewal was a significant amount of cash for a small business that was suffering due to the impacts of COVID-19. I wrote several emails requesting a exception due to the conditions and no one ever responded. After my fourth email I then received a notification that I had been blocked.

Even so, you regulate the image resolution that you are receiving or sending does not stop saturating the network and affects the work of other users."

The one thing that's confusing about the software is that they say ""free for personal use"" and ""upgrade with enterprise"", but they offer a 15-day trial (https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/start-trial/) which is a sneaky way to get leads to demo the upgraded product.

I have to find another solution now... TeamViewer's prices from what I've seen are outrageous... unless maybe you really are using it for commercial use and have a lot of $$$$ to spend. I recommend looking into RealVNC if you actually need something for commercial use. Much cheaper. It's what I use for commercial use.

Unfortunately, that generation's folks are scattered across the country. Have you ever tried solving a computer problem simply by talking an 86 year old through it? When I came across Teamviewer, I gave it a whirl and immediately found it to be perfect for remote troubleshooting. My parents and aunt could figure out how to install it, and getting our session going was easy.

More pro-consumer vs pro-business that argument though.

However since day 1 they started implementing aggressive and absurd tactics to monetize their service which has resulted in a mass market of remote desktop software - many of which are free and even more of which do a much better job than teamviewer. the only reason i'm still using it is lazyness, my own and other peoples, and actually i have grown to welcome the moment when TV decides a certain PC is using the software ""commercially"", because that is the last day that computer or the owner of it will see the the TeamViewer software.",29/5/2020,"Pros: it is very easy to connect to an own computer, unattended or otherwise, or to an outside one. Securing the list of my computers is very assuring.",Cons: Absurd prices and even more absurd and UNLAWFUL usage tracking and forcing of users based on that tracking to pay the absurd prices. the company or the software have no future.

However, depending on what you intend to use it for, it may remain free. It is exceptionally user friendly and simple to implement. Also, it has great security measures. In order to connect to another computer, the end user of that machine has to except the invitation and enter the code that the person who initialize the conmection has.",Cons: There isn't much not to like.

I recommend it all the time.",23/4/2020,"Pros: I used it to manage an computer and have a software running all night the whole week. It was very easy to access, even from the phone web navigator. I guess there is the best feature, you can manage any computer even from your cellphone.","Cons: Well is obvious that to get another computer managed it must be turned on and logged in, I guess that's all I can find to ""complain"" or mark at least to see if the TV team gets on a solution for that.

Their support is poor and I don't think highly of some of their business practices. When you sign up for TeamViewer you sign up for an recurring Annual subscription (no big deal there... very common in SAAS). However they do not notify you that you are coming up for renewal and they hide behind their ""you need to tell us 30 days before renewal policy"". Shows they have a weak product if they don't at-least let consumer decide to keep using their product. So please be aware of this, especially if you sign up for the first year on a discount.",24/3/2020,Pros: This tool does work well. Allows us to remote into desktops to support customers who are running their own servers. Has a lot of flexibility around which users can access/control specific features.,Cons: It's not a product you can just get up and go right out of the box.
