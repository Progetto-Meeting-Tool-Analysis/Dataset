1,1 Asana,Asana,Michael D.,Publishing Manager,Government Administration,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“Great task-management and collaboration tool”,Overall: It's a breeze to use and it enables our busy publishing team of 10 to collaborate and stay on top of our day-to-day. It also gives me the paper trail I need for quarterly and annual reporting. Highly recommended.,10/6/2019,Pros: It's very easy to implement and to onboard new users. The interface is attractive and very intuitive. New features are appearing every few months - the recently added Portfolio/Workload feature is brilliant. Now I get the Gantts I need to monitor my team's workload and our many projects.,Cons: Being able to estimate hours per task would make Workload even more useful. Keyword search (for completed tasks/projects etc.) can be a little flakey.
2,2 Asana,Asana,Rachel S.,Executive Administrator,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,4,5,4,4,9,“This is your new (improved) pile of sticky notes”,"Overall: Love Asana and how it's improved our organization and functionality, especially with a completely remote team working together across timezones.",15/10/2020,"Pros: LOVE being able to label, sort, prioritize, date, assign, attach files to items, create sub lists, and so much more to organize multiple complex projects with a team. Especially helpful when everyone works remotely! Helps you keep your brain free for problem solving, processing, conversations, and dreaming rather than trying to hold deadlines and details and project flows at the same time. Your team will communicate more efficiently with notifications. LOVE IT","Cons: It can be a little complex to get the hang of, but for basic use it's a pretty simple learning curve. Getting into timelines, sub lists, etc takes a little work, but is totally worth it. The other caveat is that you have to commit actually using it all the time to keep it updated and accurate. Again, totally worth it."
3,3 Asana,Asana,Aliz G.,Program Manager Junior,Computer Hardware,2+ years,3,5,4,,4,7,“Good Startup Project Management Tool”,"Overall: It was a very good tool to use, highly user friendly, quite effective and very visually attractive. This tool is great for startups in my opinion and the price is fair for the features it has.",30/9/2019,"Pros: I like how user friendly it is, the aesthetics (looks), it's very neat and colorful at the same time, it provides a good option for organization and I think it's a good tool for startups, it makes planning, task assignment, tracking and registering much easier.","Cons: I think the software is amazing but it lacks some features seen on more robusts tools such as Zoho Projects, still, this tool can integrate with other small tools that can give you access to Gantt Charts or timelines, etc. The problem is you have to pay for those additional integrations."
4,4 Asana,Asana,FAIBREY D.,Data Analyst,Farming,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Simplified teamwork with improved transparency”,Overall: We have seen an improvement in reporting standards since we started using Asana. Team members are transparent and it is very easy to see everything and help those that are having challenges completing projects.,30/7/2020,"Pros: We started using it on free trial and we realized the first week that this is the software we wanted. One of the best factors is that it is updated regularly to add new features without an additional fee on us. With our team we are able to set goals and divide them into smaller goals that are distributed among team members in the software and we are able to track easily progress on each goal based on deadlines. We are able to track workloads and monitor portfolios on a single dashboard with a few clicks which makes it very user friendly. When we rolled it out we did not need special training as it is very easy to use. We automated all routine tasks in the software to save time and reduce errors. In addition, another feature I enjoy is the use of forms that are user friendly to submit work requests. They are very easy to fill.","Cons: Although it gives the option to secure documents and data from editing by enabling the comment-only feature, it does not restrict viewing of the data of which it is a feature they can add to make sure there is selection on who can view data among the team members."
5,5 Asana,Asana,Robert S.,Owner,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“Leading project management software for good reason”,"Overall: We went from a major competitor, one with a lot of card-based tracking, that was not as effective with prioritizing tasks. Asana has been much more effective in connecting operators and managers with their day-to-day tabulation of work and awareness of deadlines.",3/11/2020,"Pros: The ability to bring in all members of a team and see the workflow from conception to completion is why Asana is the best for project management software. Integration of tasks, files and prioritized milestones are all top of the line here.","Cons: The financial side of things are better managed with third-party software, as the interface can be less than intuitive at times, but the good news is that the Asana customer support team is excellent if you have questions about integrating bookkeeping software."
6,6 Asana,Asana,Aram Z.,CTO,Food & Beverages,2+ years,5,5,4,5,4,10,“Great for operations”,Overall:,27/7/2020,"Pros: I love the mobile app, it's been really easy to get down quick tasks through the day. The simple list structure allows for rapid planning. Then leveraging the same list to create sections is great.",Cons: I feel limited to how I can filter and sort tasks from the team. The description section feels weak compared to tools like Notion.
7,7 Asana,Asana,Dimitris R.,"Partner, CRM Director",Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,“Great project management system”,Overall: Asana is the defacto service that we use to run out of the entire business. Ideal for dealing with our internal processes and project management for our clients.,22/9/2020,"Pros: Asana does a great job of tracking the overall aspect of all our projects (internal and external). It is very easy to use and maintain as well as to customize the way that it works. So, we are able to create a seamless experience and workflow for all users on out organization. The ability to add multiple additional fields to the main fields of the system provides a great framework to work the exact way we want.",Cons: I would love to have more control over files that are stored on each task. A central system for storing would be ideal.
8,8 Asana,Asana,Shawn M.,Digital Marketing Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,5,5,,4,10,“A great project management solution for small teams.”,"Overall: Asana has a clear interface, full feature set and user friendly interface.",28/7/2020,Pros: The interface is very simple and easy to use. It is similar to an interactive checklist. We can break up each client into different jobs that all have certain tasks and sub-tasks. Tasks can easily be assigned to multiple different team members and have timelines assigned to them. There also is a fun animation of a creature like a phoenix or a yetti that flies across the screen when a task is marked as complete. Helps make production meetings more fun,"Cons: There are the occassional bugs. We originally had issues with sub-tasks becoming misplaced if you marked their parent task as complete. This has since been fixed. Overall, it's a lot better than others our team has used."
9,9 Asana,Asana,Victor F.,Diretor de Produto,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,3,3,3,2,5,"“Useful, but gets complex and expensive way too quickly”",Overall: I'm acquiring overall visibility over my projects and managing tasks and schedules quite efficienty.,4/8/2020,Pros: Useful. You can definitely get a handle on your work there. Integrations help deliver more value for the product.,"Cons: Forces you into very expensive seats. In order to assign a simple task to a team member that may not be that important, but may be interested in having some visibility over the task, will cost you a full seat of a heavy user/team leader."
10,10 Asana,Asana,Laura P.,Social Media Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,3,3,4,,5,6,“Not so simple but very useful”,"Overall: Asana is a nice tool, but it's just not for me. There was too much information on the screen and I would often get lost in the sea of tools they offer. But I recognize it is an amazing software and many teams can benefit from it while working online.",22/9/2020,"Pros: Asana has many different functionalities for project management. It has a beautiful and visual workspace where you can list, track and tackle different tasks in your daily work.","Cons: The main feature I dislike in Asana is its lack of functions for recurrent tasks. My work demands different routines every week and month, so it was a little bit difficult to set those up."
11,11 Asana,Asana,Shashank P.,Digital Marketing Analyst,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,5,5,5,9,“Easiest Way to Manage Your Team Work and Tasks Handling”,"Overall: We have many promoting enactments spread over different time spans and over numerous brands we own. Having the option to arrange the entirety of this successfully and keep everybody on time has been a huge assistance and has spared us endless long stretches of time. We utilize this apparatus day by day to keep everybody on target, and I was unable to be more joyful with the outcomes. We have seen an improvement in announcing guidelines since we began utilizing Asana. Colleagues are straightforward and it is anything but difficult to see everything and help those that are having difficulties finishing ventures.",21/10/2020,"Pros: It's anything but difficult to actualize and to installed new clients. The interface is alluring and instinctive. New highlights are showing up at regular intervals - the as of late included Portfolio/Workload include is splendid. Presently I get the Gantts I have to screen my group's remaining task at hand and our numerous undertakings. Incredible labeling and search capacities make it exceptionally easy to monitor our horde promoting enactments and all their related expectations. Including subtasks and including teammates errands makes it extremely simple to monitor who needs to do what and by when. Different perspectives like records, schedules, and kanban sheets make it open to everybody in the group who thinks and cycles data in an unexpected way. The UX is perfect and basic, and the 'my undertakings' and 'inbox' highlights help us all monitor what's going on in our allocated zones.","Cons: The main con I have is that there is fairly a lofty expectation to absorb information for a portion of the further developed highlights, and there's some genuine reasoning and truly difficult work needed to get everything spread out and composed in the device and afterward get everybody onboarded. Be that as it may, I think this is likely going to be the situation with any group embracing a task the executives instrument. Despite the fact that it gives the choice to make sure about archives and information from altering by empowering the remark just element, it doesn't limit survey of the information of which it is a component they can add to ensure there is choice on who can see information among the colleagues."
12,12 Asana,Asana,Vanessa A.,Executive Assistant,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,"“Asana helps me stay organized and on track, it's not always perfect but it's always improving”","Overall: I use Asana a daily basis in my work and personal life. I get my thoughts laid out and am sure to enter all of the tasks I need to keep on my radar so they are out of my head and I can sleep at night! I love how I can also I love the basic set up of Asana. I had been using it for years in my jobs, my business, and even my personal life. I love how well it helped me keep track of my tasks and projects. It helps me see what I need from different views but also keep items on my radar in my own projects while keeping them on the radar on my teammates projects. I love all of the features it has and keeps adding. And most of all I really appreciate that even though it is not a perfect tool it is constantly improving. Their Rules (automations) seem like a great start as it is a new feature, I'm already making use of it. It's very helpful that tasks can live in multiple projects and that you can switch from different views (previously you had to pick one and could not change it). The custom fields come in handy all of the time",17/10/2020,Pros: I love the basic set up and that you can switch between different views (when previously you had to choose one). Portfolios are great for keeping an eye on multiple projects. Having the ability to add tasks to multiple projects is a big plus and very helpful so that tasks can be seen from various perspectives. It's helpful also having the tag feature to group related tasks from various projects. It's great that I can add emails straight to the projects as tasks and it's clickable so if I need to get more info or reply to the email its easy to find and open. Custom fields are incredibly helpful so we can get the customized information that we need. Forms I a great feature as well though I haven't been able to get much use of them as they are right now.,"Cons: There are minor items that I'm not satisfied with. Automations/rules are very limited & it seems unnecessary to limit the # per project. The triggers & actions are also pretty limited but I understand this is a newer feature. I wish they'd incorporate tags into the automations. It also seems that the Gmail extension has not been updated in a long time. I wish some of the features were incorporated. For instance, I'd like to note what section of a project a task goes in while saving it. It's not very helpful if I need to go & find it in Asana to edit it. I wish there were a better way to work with templates, I don't like that templates look like regular projects in your list. It'd also be great if we could have templates for tasks as well. I wish there was a way to organize your favorites, perhaps by having sections. It'd be helpful if milestones could have a start & end date. The inbox is a bit overwhelming, it seems to capture everything & while you can just focus on the important items (like mentions) it still feels cluttered when you're on the main view & see every little update. Reporting could be improved on. It's a bit glitchy whenever you make a change to the report, you have to resave & also the only format that is helpful to me is the CSV but I wish it would produce a Google sheet & I wish we could control what fields get exported. I wish forms had more conditional logic as I can't really use them well as is."
13,13 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Aviation & Aerospace,2+ years,5,5,5,4,4,10,“A must have for geographically disperse teams”,Overall: Love it! Can't live without it. I'm better at my job and better at working with my team because of it.,1/10/2020,Pros: I use this tool to stay organized and provide visibility to my teammates with my individual work. I also use it to implement processes for planning and task management for a team that sits across three different regions in the world. It really helps keep us all on the same page.,Cons: It is easy to get disorganized with this tool. You really need to manage what you create. It can get messy and confusing if you don't use the features intelligently.
14,14 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,10,“Asana for Digital Agencies”,Overall: I solved the workload of every member of my team and the priority of each task. I was able to have a clear and open vision of the situation with each client and deliver their requests on time. It was very helful to us.,14/9/2020,"Pros: I used Asana for 1-2 years while I was working on a Social Media Agency. It helped me a lot to organize my team. I was able to track all the tasks in their differents stages and also I could know the workload of every member of my team. Also I integrated Asana with my Gmail and created tasks from there, very easy and quickly.","Cons: When I started using Asana, I had trouble copying and pasting images directly from the email body. Then when they achieved integration with Gmail, this was resolved. Also, email notifications were quite annoying until I learned how to disable them. Maybe they could add a feature to only send email notifications for important tasks."
15,15 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Graphic Design,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Robust Project Management Software for Creative Agency”,"Overall: Asana has allowed our business to become so much more streamlined, and we no longer worry about dropping balls or missing deadlines. We have been able to accomplish so much more work because of our organization within Asana.",6/8/2020,"Pros: Asana has been integral to our business in the last few years -- the platform allows for robust content / project management. We are a small design and web development agency, and we're finally able to track our projects from first inquiry to project close. Asana has been an amazing tool for keeping our processes efficient and transparent, and we've set up teams shared with some clients so that they too can be aware of our progress on their projects. We've also been doing all this using the free version -- we briefly tried a demo of the paid tier, but we found that for our small (and somewhat change-averse) team, the free version has virtually everything we need.","Cons: There are some elements of Asana that are surprisingly inflexible -- we'd love to have more color options to differentiate our projects and tags, rather than having to use the same 16 colors, for example. And the email notifications are not great -- they send more than is necessary, and they're not very customizable. Asana's customer support team is responsive, but all the requests we have appear to also have been in the request queue for years."
16,16 Asana,Asana,Benjamin W.,Developer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,8,“Asana Makes Projects Easy”,"Overall: Using Asana has been simple and effective. It has been very easy to manage the day to day, mid range & long term tasks that I need to stay on top of. Asana's user-friendly & intuitive interface has made it a welcome addition to my workflow management",2/8/2020,"Pros: The thing I like most about Asana is the ease with which you can update a task. Asana has a very simple & intuitive interface. It was very easy to update the tasks, create new tasks, make notes, etc., all from the home screen.","Cons: I have been using the free version, so not all features are available to me. I would like be able to create multiple projects, but I think that is available in the paid version. For now, and for what I've been using the program to assist with, I don't have any cons about Asana."
17,17 Asana,Asana,Chase H.,Creative Brand Director,Retail,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,9,“A god-send for getting us organized”,"Overall: We have a lot of different marketing activations spread over various time periods and across multiple brands we own. Being able to organize all of this effectively and keep everyone on schedule has been a tremendous help and has saved us countless hours of time. We use this tool daily to keep everyone on track, and I couldn't be happier with the results.",9/7/2020,"Pros: Powerful tagging and search functions make it very simple to keep track of our myriad marketing activations and all their associated deliverables. Adding subtasks and including collaborators on tasks makes it very easy to keep track of who needs to do what and by when. Various views like lists, calendars, and kanban boards make it accessible to everyone on the team who thinks and processes information differently. The UX is clean and simple, and the 'my tasks' and 'inbox' features help us all keep track of what's happening in our assigned areas.","Cons: The only con I have is that there is somewhat of a steep learning curve for some of the more advanced features, and there's some serious thinking and heavy lifting required to get everything laid out and organized in the tool and then get everyone onboarded. However, I think this is likely going to be the case with any team adopting a project management tool."
18,18 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,4,5,4,4,4,8,“Only one issue....”,Overall:,24/6/2020,"Pros: I have been using Asana since 2013 and have taken it with me to each job I have had since. I love the adaptability of the program. I'm able to use it as a daily task list and can use it to manage a team and a project. They have a lot of ready-made templates that you can use, or you can create your own to use repeatedly like for a board meeting or other projects that have the same tasks each time. I constantly am recommending it to other Executive Assistants as it tends to play well with most programs.","Cons: The main complaint I have is that it does not work with Google Aliases. So if your company has a main address, but uses aliases for different departments it will not recognize the alias which means you can't email the project or tasks in Asana. It's not a deal-breaker, but it is a hassle. I've seen many complaints about this but Asana is deaf to them and refuses to correct this. That leads to the arrogance that tends to come through for items like this and attitudes towards religious non-profits, I find it rather sad as it is a really good program, but they are comfortable with it and not willing to help..."
19,19 Asana,Asana,Marcelo V.,Agile Coach,Financial Services,2+ years,5,4,4,4,4,8,“My Asana Review (Brasilcap)”,"Overall: I am happy with it overall, but then i am a heavy user. I see that other team members take sometime to assimilate its potential and value",22/6/2020,"Pros: Once you know where to go, it's show great use on promoting transparency and team collaboration","Cons: Lack of reports Scrum/Kanban likes. A Query engine would be superb. I use these at Jira and helps a lot. Also some constraints vallidation, configuration/confirmation os necessary fields, things like that"
20,20 Asana,Asana,Odette S.,Deputy Executive Director,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,"“Intuitive, Powerful, and Beautiful To Do App”","Overall: Asana has allowed our office to both keep extremely flexible and extremely specific project to-do lists. It also allows us to keep our conversations about an issue or project in one place, archived for all time. Additionally, we are able to keep reference information about each project in Asana, creating one central place to check for details, status, and tasks on each project.",22/6/2020,"Pros: Asana is extremely easy to implement in an office. The design is clean and intuitive and feels very familiar and easy to use from Day 1. Love the ability to create tracking boards or lists, depending on what my need is; and the ability to switch between both of these views is a huge plus. The animations are a delight. Love the Chrome and Gmail plug-ins, I use those multiple times a day. I liked Asana so much that I implemented it at home to keep our family on track and organized.","Cons: I wish there was the ability to personalize the skin of the app more -- different backgrounds for the desktop, stickers. I also wish that Asana could integrate with electronic planners to replace their to-do list function."
21,21 Asana,Asana,Linda S.,Project Manager,Management Consulting,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,10,“Without Asana? Without me!”,"Overall: Every process, every step, every project - it's all about Asana. It ""lives"" in Asana which saves us time for other stuff. Asana makes going to work fun for everyone since we know where we can find everything and where we DO everything.",20/6/2020,Pros: Asana is a Game-Changer. It truly optimized our processes since we can automate them with this amazing tool. Also everyone in the company is able to work from wherever they want - only by using Asana. It is the best tool for organizing projects and keeping in touch with all the people in your company. You can do repeating processes as well as agile projects. I love it! And I will recommend it to everyone who is in need of having better working processes - and of course more time for other stuff.,Cons: Sometimes it's all about the details. And there are some things in Asana that need to be fixed: e.g. you need formular drafts that you can simply duplicate as well as not having a maximum number in custom fields. It would be also nice if you could automate and individualize custom rules more - but as I said: just details.
22,22 Asana,Asana,Amber B.,Operations Manager,Executive Office,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Asana Review”,"Overall: We have really been able to streamline processes using asana. Also, being able to really have one place to house all info about a project. I also love using the workload feature. This way I can work with sales to see who needs more work and who is about to go on overload.",19/6/2020,"Pros: User friendly, ability to use minimal features to as in depth as you want. This helps a lot for my Executives that don't need to know the ins and outs. Also, the training videos help tremendously to on-board a new employee who has never used the software before. I don't have to come up with my own.",Cons: Still waiting on Forms that can be created and used at a Team level and not just a project level. I'd love to be able to do more automation with in the software itself. Right now I have to use google forms and zapier to do any if/then functionality.
23,23 Asana,Asana,Vasileios N.,Web Development Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,4,4,5,8,“Asana is the tool of choice when managing digital media projects”,"Overall: Asana is the tool of choice when you want to manage digital media projects. The ability to implement strictly Scrum , Kanban rules is up to you without any restrictions set from the software - and you can be as versatile as you want.",19/6/2020,"Pros: - Asana is a really intuitive project management tool with a really small learning curve comparing to the likes of Jira, Monday and Airtable. New team members can easily get onboard without much training. - Really flexible as well as it lets you create all kind of project boards based on your needs. Does not restrict you to a specific logic i.e. Jira ; while at the same time gives you tools to organize and shape your project plan as you like eg. with the use of Custom Fields - really cool",Cons: - The Portfolio functionality being on the Business tier - Having to enroll ALL team members to Business tier and not just some members of the team i.e. just the line Managers. Not everyone needs to have access to the Business tier features and tools.
24,24 Asana,Asana,Laura A.,Research Coordinator,Research,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“Excellent for professional AND personal use”,"Overall: When I started with my company a little more than a year ago, we knew we needed to find ways to streamline our workflows and keep everyone on the same page. I found Asana and it was a near-perfect fit. It has taken a bit to get everyone on-board with the software because it was different than how they've worked before, but we're rolling along now. We wish there was a bit more flexibility with certain built-in features like the progress reports, but overall, as a small research company, it's really helping us work together.",19/6/2020,"Pros: I'm with a very small company, but we still find Asana helpful for keeping up to date with everyone's tasks. Comments, progress reports, and the ability to connect tasks with dependencies allow us to function as a team, tagging in and out of a project as needed, without missing a beat.","Cons: There is a learning curve for those that are more inclined towards pen/paper lists, which has made implementation a little bumpy. Also we find that because certain things are built-in (like project statuses), we can't always capture precisely where we're at. For instance, there isn't a way to indicate in progress reports that something is ""On hold""."
25,25 Asana,Asana,Hugo C.,Projects managers,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,5,4,4,9,"“Free version is already great, it is even better when you upgrade”","Overall: I have been using Asana for many years, when I need to refer to a good and useful tool for managing project, I always say Asana. Moreover the free version offers all the needed basic features, it is impressive.",5/5/2020,"Pros: The clean UI, the board and custom fields.",Cons: Subtasks management (mostly in the board view) because too much click to reach them and no overall view (no nice hierarchical view with parents and child tasks).
26,26 Asana,Asana,Sarah F.,Graphic Designer,Design,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Highly recommend Asana”,Overall:,28/4/2020,"Pros: I love how easy this software is to navigate. Due to the clean and simplified design, I can ""add/create a task"" with the click of a button. It gives me the options to add a project title, project description, due date and even categorize the assignment. As a Graphic Designer, each design project falls in various categories, and it is extremely helpful to be able to label each one. I also love how easy it is to add people to your account, and not only be able to assign or pass projects along to them, but to be able to view their project lists as well. Lastly, it only took a few minutes to have someone explain to me how to navigate the software, which is not only wonderful, but time efficient.","Cons: I would love if there could be a feature where you can instant chat your friends. With that chat box, we could easily talk about project details, etc, instead of having to open up a separate browser to write out an email. I believe having a chat box would allow more direct and faster communication."
27,27 Asana,Asana,Eddie L.,Co-Founder,Education Management,2+ years,5,5,4,,,9,“Best in class product”,,24/3/2020,,"Cons: Not everything is perfect, but newer versions started limiting some functionality about how we represent data about specific items on the task list. Sometimes I wish tasks could be tracked in a more storyboard format, but that was less for the use case of software development, and there are other platforms for that."
28,28 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Food & Beverages,2+ years,4,3,4,3,4,7,"“Asana is a great team tool, but could use some tweaks.”",Overall:,19/3/2020,"Pros: Overall, Asana is a very robust and well-rounded project management tool for teams, allowing for near complete customization depending on your need. It can be used as a very high level/overview approach to projects and tasks, down to a very granular and detailed level of project management.","Cons: While the software is incredibly robust and able to be manipulated to your individual or team need, the lack of structure can be a bit daunting. Our small design studio has fairly replicable and common design 'tasks', yet despite my endless searching and researching, there seemed to be little in the way of 'templates' for client/branding-driven graphic design studios, to get started. Rather, it feels very geared toward web and developer design tasks. Also, while I do often work with clients transparently throughout the design process (allowing them into Asana to help accomplish tasks), as well as contractors, Asana is not particularly friendly for studios as small as mine. Rather, it is more geared towards larger studios with many internal 'teams.' And, clients can get lost commenting and checking and responding and sharing within the platform, as the Inbox feature feels cluttered and sometimes lacking visual hierarchy. For example, a comment can end up attached to a specific sub-task, where it will not be seen easily in the overall project task-and getting missed altogether sometimes. Lastly, while Asana is very customizable, some of the ways they treat teams vs. projects vs. tasks can feel a bit backwards, leaving you to 'jerry-rig' the layout and items to work in a best-case project flow for you or your team."
29,29 Asana,Asana,Mike G.,President,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Asana for Client Social Media Project Management”,Overall: It's our go-to project management tool for client social media work. We are a remote team so we need a cloud-based tool to keep everything organized and it does just that. Love the mobile app as well.,19/3/2020,Pros: Asana has been a huge asset for our team. We can break client work down and keep it all orderly in one place with great updates.,Cons: Sometimes I get to many emails! Takes time to go in and identify who should get what alerts and updates.

Our experience using the software has been great. It's helped my team to stay on top of multiple projects/deadlines at the same time without letting anything slip through the cracks.",16/3/2020,"Pros: Asana is extremely beneficial for tracking your progress/success on large team projects or individual tasks. The key features Asana offers can help you to ensure your team meets specific deadlines, any stumbling blocks are addressed in realtime, and it keeps everyone on the same page. I've used other project management softwares, such as Teamwork and Asana has been the most user friendly platform I've used to date. If you have members on your team that work better with daily reminders, this can be extremely beneficial to keep them on track and ensure high productivity","Cons: There's one thing in particular that I've found to be frustrating with Asana. Their customer service has been extremely hard to reach at times. They do have employees with phone extensions, but you won't be able to find them online. They do provide a chat feature, but don't always follow up in a timely manner, which can be frustrating if you're operating on a deadline. Specifically, we had an issue with our billing and I could not get a hold of someone from Asana for weeks. We fortunately found a way to contact a representative from an email I had saved from prior communication. Aside from this, I have no cons to point out about the functionalities of the software itself. It's a great tool and would beneficial for any team to use."
31,31 Asana,Asana,Nic M.,Freelance Consultant,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,4,4,4,8,“Accuracy for teams!”,Overall: Asana has helped me help my clients in increasing efficiency and establishing an understanding between multiple business areas.,26/2/2020,"Pros: Asana has a number of templates and various different ways to manage and execute projects of different natures. For example, I use and always suggest to my clients that they use a weekly meeting templates where the sections match the various business operations such as marketing, operations, accounts, warehouse, etc. This allows items for discussion to be addressed in the weekly meeting and then allocated to the projects and individuals for execution. It's great for collaborating and ensuring that everyone in a team nails their dealings.","Cons: I do find it a bit pricey for smaller businesses, especially when handling multiple clients/projects from a single account and each project needs to be private. It's too expensive for freelancers or small agencies."
32,32 Asana,Asana,Gabriel E.,Business Analyst,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,4,3,10,“Best way to coordinate work between agile teams”,"Overall: Asana is one of those tools you can't live without when you add it to your workflow. It offers great capabilities to coordinate people and leave all decisions made about a topic in the same place. If everybody in your organization is using it, you can really leverage its power. Its beauty relays in its simplicity, you can't make fancy things such as track progress of a big project distributed between several teams, but you can use your imagination to go over these issues. The API will give you all the flexibility you need if you know how to code.",20/2/2020,"Pros: - The ease of use of Asana is one of the best out there no matter the product. It's so easy to start creating task and discover what can you do with them it easily adjusts to your work flows, specially if you work with lots of people. - Everybody can edit tasks, this allows to use Asana as a hub for communicating everything related to a topic, tagging tasks and mentioning people so they get notified. - Hotkeys, I hate going back and forth between the keyboard and mouse (hate using touchpad), Asana provides hotkeys for almost everything you need to do, tab will be your magic key.","Cons: Poor reporting. I work in agile projects and would like to see BurnUps and burn downs, be able to define sprints and reporting associated to the big picture. To do so, you have to manually create projects that act as sprints, you end up with lots of projects and lose the big picture. On the bright side, it provides an API, so I connected to it, and using tags I was able to create customized reporting. Expensive, its cost compare to world-class project management solutions, like Jira. I believe it's worth the money, but as a small company we couldn't afford it. (this was a year ago, before starting at Globant)"
33,33 Asana,Asana,Mackenzie J.,Marketing Director,Sports,2+ years,4,4,4,,5,8,“An Advanced Version of Trello”,Overall:,6/2/2020,"Pros: Asana operates similarly to a Trello board, but has more features and functionality, making it a better investment for teams and individual contributors. Asana enables you to both track tasks along a customizable set of groups and track/prioritize tasks for individuals and teams. Not only that, Asana's interface makes it easy to have and store conversations pertaining to project success with real-time alerts when a new comment is added. It has made working with my team and other business units much easier","Cons: Asana does have some limited functionality that can result in lengthy conversations within each project ""card."" Because you are unable to link text, you must paste the full URL, which can get messy when you are adding 5-10 URLs to outside pages/docs/etc. We also cannot add rich text features like tables, which would prevent us from creating a GoogleDoc with the table and adding the link to the text thread. Small inconveniences, but inconveniences nonetheless."
34,34 Asana,Asana,Jillian S.,Vice President - Campaign Operations,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,9,“Best Project Management Platform”,Overall: My team manages Marketing Campaigns and Design Projects with Asana - we did a trial with Monday.com and ended up staying with Asana because of the over all features and capability of the platform along with ease of daily use...Asana is by far the most user friendly task management platform available,4/2/2020,Pros: I have recently optimized my team Asana usage by increasing the number of projects they can manage on their own in addition to Admin view / reporting...these optimizations were a GAME CHANGER for me as the administrator and manager of up to 15 Asana users. It takes a bit if playing around with features but everyday my team is becoming more efficient through their Asana project and task management.,"Cons: The only thing that could have swayed me to rate this platform a full 10/10 would be the Customer Support. There is no ""live chat"" feature with Asana which makes it incredibly difficult and TIME CONSUMING for the clients to research and dig around the articles and forums to find answers for them selves. I'm a millennial and do a ton of research before I get to the point of frustration in not finding what I need so it takes A LOT for me to seek out a response from support. My answers are not easily found and I spent about 3 weeks trying to figure features out on my own - ""live chat"" with support would get this to 10/10."
35,35 Asana,Asana,Filipe F.,Delevoper,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,9,“Asana review”,Overall: Asana is the best way to organize my work and share project status with clients Easy to use on desktop and mobile,31/1/2020,"Pros: Asana is a great application to organize my tasks I can organize it by projet or client or software version, .... we can define tags to organize task and projects With Asana I can have a overview of my projects where I want, work great of mobile as too Asana can share task with others, to great overview of project Asana is easy to use for all people",Cons: At moment Asana have a lot of functionalities that is enough for organize my work I use it every day with out any problem
36,36 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Services,2+ years,4,5,4,5,4,9,“Intuitive Collaboration and Project Tracking Tool”,"Overall: I have been using Asana for close to two years now to track my day-to-day activities, project cutover tasks and tracking support tickets. I like the design and the layout of the tool and how intuitive every action is. Would definitely recommend it.",15/1/2020,Pros: Ease of Use - The tool is intuitive. No learning curve needed. Organized User Interface. Automated Email Notifications. Cloud Service - Can be accessed using thin client. Search feature works well and is fast. Adding Tags.,Cons: Unintentional clicks sometimes triggers actions. Configuring the automated emails was a bit confusing - Emails were sent out to the whole project team whenever a new task was created which we didn't want. We eventually configured it properly.
37,37 Asana,Asana,Dave M.,Director,Design,2+ years,5,5,4,,,10,“Fantastic project management app”,Overall: Very pleased with Asana for project management and I now use it with any project that has milestones and multiple people involved. I tried many project management apps but Asana was the clear winner. And as it is free it is a no brainer,7/1/2020,"Pros: I really like the way you can structure a project and see what has been done, and what is left to do on one screen. Many apps hide completed tasks but with Asana you see everything. Assigning tasks, due dates and commenting on tasks is very easy. I also like the different ways you an view milestones (list view, calendar view, etc).","Cons: Customers sometimes found it a bit hard to get started. I'm not sure if this is anything to do with Asana or with clients just getting used to something new. Once I had a 5 minute phone conversation to go through it with them, they were on board and using it easily. Some clients switched over to using it exclusively."
38,38 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,4,,4,8,“Great task-oriented project management tool”,"Overall: We manage all projects with Asana. It's really a great tool! I've tried Jira and Trello, but Asana wins them all",3/1/2020,"Pros: + Easy to use (task oriented) + Statuses, projects... + Collaboration (description, conversations, attachments, notification) + Gantt chart is great! + Slick UI and UX! Great work","Cons: - Premium features (processes, automations) come with a premium price - Missing feature: a place to store all product feature specs (documents) - like editable documents in folders (something what Jira has with Confluence, but with better UI/UX)"
39,39 Asana,Asana,Bethany M.,Pastor,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,10,“Lots of Functions”,Overall: We love Asana and tell people about all of the functions within it that allow us to streamline most of our work and communication.,25/12/2019,"Pros: Asana is so diverse in it's functions that it meets all kinds of organizational and communication needs. We use it at our church for simple tasks lists, meeting follow-up tasks, small to large team projects as well as having long-term groups distinctions within Asana to create projects within. There's even a great feature that allows you to keep ongoing conversations and document links within specific tasks or project teams. I even have a separate folder within my Asana username for personal tasks and projects for my family, so all the distinctions are helpful.","Cons: Asana is getting easier and easier to use with time and the developers have been making it more intuitive, but it was harder to figure out than a couple other project managers we tried."
40,40 Asana,Asana,Billy H.,SEO Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,4,,,9,“Asana is great both as a freeware option for task management and larger business tracking”,Overall: Asana is an effective tool for any size organization from the solo entrepreneur to the 1000+ person team. I recommend it and have used it in multiple of my own projects,5/12/2019,"Pros: Asana has the ability to filter extremely granular from major projects all the way do to individual tasks done within the project. While it can't give 'status updates' for every portion of a major project you've worked on, you can track all of the things you've completed. This means when you have top-down organizations that want to be able to track everything that's going on a site, they have the ability to do so and drill into the current tasks being worked on","Cons: Asana has 2 major issues - 1st is the lack of export features to excel or other spreadsheet type formats. My company ended up having us do dual tracking because it would not allow this. 2nd, tasks put in a board that aren't used very much are extremely easy to forget about. This means without manual checks a lot of 'to-do' type items never saw the light of day again when surrounded by another large list of 20+ things."
41,41 Asana,Asana,Ciera H.,Impact Coordinator,Media Production,2+ years,5,3,5,4,5,10,“Best Platform for Project/Team Management”,"Overall: Initially it was a bit overwhelming to set up and sort through all of the features and uses, but once you work with your team and figure out a system it is hands down the most useful and intuitive workspace / task management platform. There are always new features and integrations to be learned which is great to experiment and use as you grow with the platform.",5/12/2019,"Pros: The best part about Asana is how customizable it is in so many different facets, you can really tailor it to the needs of your specific team and project. The amount of functions that it has and its ability to integrate other apps and services within it makes it extremely versatile and intelligent once you customize it to all of your needs. I also enjoy that there is a mobile app version.","Cons: With all of its endless functionality tools - it can be a bit daunting in setting up the ideal layout and structure of use for your team. There are so many options and features that can make the software seem almost too sophisticated and complicated for everyday use. Not exactly user friendly up front, but once you figure it out and are patient in working out tailoring your workspace it is very useful and covers all bases."
42,42 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,3,5,3,5,9,"“Pretty much quite literally, my life is in Asana's hands. ”","Overall: Generally, having ALL of my upcoming tasks (and past tasks for historical purposes) along with the granular ways I can share tasks with others has been a pleasure. I will keep using Asana and hope they fix my main gripe at some point.",4/12/2019,"Pros: Over the years, with one exception (see below) Asana has proven to be able to evolve with the times and add features while sticking to its core purpose & values. I love the integrations that are available, all that is included in the free tier, the heavy emphasis on keyboard shortcuts and the mobile app. The key feature for me was its ability to manage multiple workspaces with ease.","Cons: Honestly, I love Asana. I have used it for keeping track of my life (personal and professional) for years but there's one thing that happened this year that is a rather large pain point for me and many of its users, judging by their community forums. Every time you switch to a new workspace, it opens in a new tab. This sounds small, but it's HUGE when you're always switching back and forth. I used to use it as a web app (without the browser chrome) so it behaved like a native desktop app. Now, as soon as I open a new workspace, it launches the browser and opens in a new tab. There's no option to disable this new ""feature"" and the community has spoken. Here we are almost a year later and no explanation or solution has been given (the last time I checked). Boo. That's why I docked ease of use. Also, it's starting to feel a bit heavy on my tablet. Desktop performance is still OK but does take a while to load."
43,43 Asana,Asana,Heidi G.,Membership Engagement Coordinator,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,9,“The organizational tool to keep your life colorful and carefree”,"Overall: I'd recommend Asana to anyone who asked because I have not yet found a software that I like as much. It's colorful, inviting, and friendly. It makes you feel encouraged to look at your long list of things to do, rather than fill you with dread. In my job, I have many hats to juggle, and Asana helps to take care of it all. It's the sticky note of the internet, and I am a grateful user.",19/11/2019,"Pros: I am a sticky note person. I have sticky notes everywhere, but the problem is that sticky notes can't remind you of your tasks, notify you if you've missed a deadline, or post comments to your coworkers to find out if they've completed their portion of the task. Asana does all of that. I can organize my work life down to the millisecond if I wanted to, but that's a little overkill. Everything in Asana is clearly displayed and labeled. Our staff uses the system together, so I can keep track of what my coworkers have on their plate. It helps me to know if/when I can interrupt them or ask to assist on a task. The deadlines are helpful as well and intuitive. If you miss a task, it goes red. Check off a task, and the funniest thing happens. A unicorn shows up to congratulate you. I appreciate the humor of the software developers. It reminds me that we are all human and just want to laugh sometimes. If you have a task that needs to get done, but a coworker is the person who has to do it, no problem! Simply assign a task to them, and they will get a notification. No more tracking down staff in the office just to ask them to do something. It's a very efficient tool, and I am very happy.","Cons: There is no messaging component that allows for live chat conversations. That is the only downside. If I want to have a conversation with a coworker on a project, I have to create a comment and tag them in it- real Facebook style. If I could have a chat button to work in real time with my coworkers, I'd get rid of Slack in a heartbeat. Also, sometimes categorizing the section entitled ""My Tasks"" can be tricky. There are so many settings that you have to be very specific, like assigning a date and a person to the task (like yourself). If you accidentally write a task, but don't assign a date or person, that task could disappear somewhere into your growing list of things to do. It can be easy to lose a task if you're not careful."
44,44 Asana,Asana,Carlos T.,Gerente de Proyectos y Comunicaciones,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Collaborative software for project and task management. ”,"Overall: I recommend this software responsibly because it is one of the best solutions that work teams have to manage tasks and work projects. With Asana you will be able to develop different types of collaborative activities quickly and efficiently, improving the product of your work and adding to your work dynamics a lot of productivity. Acquire this software and improve your work dynamics.",11/11/2019,"Pros: Asana is a software designed to facilitate the management of projects and tasks in the working environment. The most important features of this software are the following. -It is a software that strengthens teamwork thanks to its shared workspaces, which are divided into projects and tasks. You can manage large projects, as well as you can manage small operational tasks in your work and assign obligations to other co-workers. -A well explanatory central panel, which mentions each of the details of the project or task you are carrying out and the tools applicable to your projects. -Receive instant updates on the progress of your project or tasks, plus notify you when a member of the team made changes to the project. -You can schedule meetings and pending tasks. -All the projects and tasks you are managing are stored in the Asana cloud. -It has a multiplatform application, so you can access the software from your smartphone.","Cons: Asana has one of the best project management platforms I have ever known. For more than three years I have used this software for work purposes, and both its collaborative workspace tool and the option to develop projects, tasks and store them in the cloud, work excepcionalmemte. Asana developers have done a great job developing this software for businesses. It is a very complete and efficient software for me."
45,45 Asana,Asana,Michael C.,Web Developer,Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,8,“Simple and easy task management”,"Overall:  I use this as a quick way to jot down ideas, suggestions and tasks when communicating with clients and then I can come back and expand on the tasks with more details when I have more time. Adding in sections to distinguish priority and time-frames is nice as well.",31/10/2019,Pros: It's so easy to setup a project and add in tasks when in a rush. It's extremely easy to invite people to join your organisation and being able to have up to 15 for free is amazing. I find the option of being able to view tasks in both a list and board view very useful.,Cons: I use it in a very simple manner just to manage ideas and tasks on different projects so currently there are no cons. A few years ago I did find it to load slowly but they have fixed it and increased the speed.
46,46 Asana,Asana,Ken I.,Owner,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,,5,10,"“If I only had ONE tool, this would be it.”","Overall: I use Asana every day, and it's the first thing I fire up in the morning. I can check it's inbox to see if there are any pressing issues or communications (if I hadn't already seen it in the app), and then run down my tasks which are displayed just as I've set them up. My projects are listed in the order that makes sense to me, and tasks are scheduled, communications, files, etc., all available at a click. It even talks to Toggl, so I can track my time effortlessly. As a one-man agency, I've been able to take on much more work using Asana than if I'd tried to manage everything the old way. Before I used Asana, I tried to manage projects, service and other communications via email, labels, etc., but there's just no comparison. If you make the transition to Asana, you'll be a better coordinator, project manager, business person, etc. You won't be able to help it. ;)",29/10/2019,"Pros: Asana is a very capable project coordination platform. It's very easily customized to fit my individual workflow, and extremely intuitive. I share access with some of my clients to allow them to create, edit and update tasks. I love the way this tool weans stakeholders from the jungle of email.","Cons: I wish there were a mid-level pricing tier for entrepreneurs to take advantage of some of the pro-level features, but not have to commit to the fairly pricy upgrade. Don't get me wrong, it's probably very worth it to upgrade, but I'd rather be able to choose the features that would benefit me at a reduced price rather than buy the upgrade for one or two I really want. Like when we had to buy an album just to get the 2 songs we really wanted, lol!"
47,47 Asana,Asana,Moshe D.,Director/VP,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,8,“Great clean software for managing tasks ! ”,"Overall: It helps us manage workflow, organize tasks, and delegate tasks. I use it mostly for delegating.",24/10/2019,"Pros: The interface is clean simple and fluid. There is no waiting or load time on any pages, which I consider a very important requirement in any software, especially a task management software. Its intuitive any easy to use","Cons: No good solution from time tracking. No good hierarchy option for organizing tasks. Its not built with every day tasks in mind, its more focused on projects. but its simple interface makes it easily usable for any tasks you need. Chat is near real time, but not real-time."
48,48 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Great project management software for budget nonprofits!”,"Overall: This is a great software for organization. It has upgrade features that are paid, but you can basically do everything you need to do in the free version for a small nonprofit to stay organized. I would highly recommend this if you have multiple events or fundraisers you manage for the year, or if you are an administrative professional of any kind that needs to coordinate multiple things every month (payroll, accounting, board meetings, client relationship follow ups, etc.) The free version is a no brainer for nonprofit management",22/10/2019,"Pros: I love that I can assign myself personal tasks to complete, and that I can also assign others tasks or subtasks to help me move forward with the pieces of a larger project or event that I need them to do before I can move on. This is a great software for organizing teams that can't always meet in person. We are able to coordinate across campus and ensure communication on progress is easily managed in one spot. I also love that I can set reoccuring tasks for things that must be completed monthly (like accounting exports, payroll imports, board reporting, etc.) It helps keep me on track to ensure that nothing falls through the cracks.","Cons: I don't like that you can't quickly and easily see all of your completed tasks in one spot with the task yet to be completed. I wish I had this feature so that I could better weekly report on what was accomplished while also reporting on what is coming down the pipeline. One of the only other things I don't like is that when you go to mark a task complete, and you are marking multiple, sometimes the list updates and shifts a bit so you click on the wrong one. You can click undo, but I just wish it didn't shift the items while it was refreshing the to do list."
49,49 Asana,Asana,Maria S.,Head of Product Management,Retail,2+ years,4,4,3,5,5,7,“Good software with room for improvement”,"Overall: Asana is a recommendable tool for task management with a very comforting surface. It is easy to handle and set up projects, tasks and teams. It though lacks some useful features that other task management tools like JIRA or teamwork offer.",15/10/2019,"Pros: Asana is very well designed and has a really nice optical appearance. It helps to structure projects, timetables and priorize tasks in an easy understandable way. It offers a good mobile solution with the Asana app.","Cons: Although it regularly sets up new features and helpful improvements, some features that are essential to me are missing: - The overview of my tasks is a list that can not be sorted in many ways. It only offers to select from project, due dates and likes. I would prefer a sorting by due date connected with the priority of the tasks or due date connected with projects. As I often have up to 15 or 20 tasks per day it would be great to sort them more accurately. - I miss the possibility to priorize tasks independently from their project. E. g. a task is assigned to my within a project and marked there with the priority medium. It though has high priority among my personal due tasks. - Dependencies (not sub-tasks) cannot be set between different tasks. I would like to have the possibility to set a task as dependent on the completion of another task."
50,50 Asana,Asana,Gabrielle W.,Administrator,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana - more than a to do list”,"Overall: It's a very colorful, interactive program that motivates their users to complete tasks in a timely manner. Other programs may compromise it's appearance for an easy to use dashboard, while others may forfeit the simplicity of its app to appear colorful or modern. Asana does both! Our team uses Asana on a daily basis. It's more than just a to do list, it's an app that truly makes its users feel good for getting things done. From the trendy emojis that occasionally pop up, to the easy to use dashboard, this app is a must-have for any company or team to use",13/10/2019,"Pros: It's a very colorful, interactive program that motivates their users to complete tasks in a timely manner.",Cons: There is some confusion in regards to setting up the projects or team boards. There doesn't seem to be a way to duplicate tasks on a team board to a private project.

I have been planning my weeks with Asana. Whenever I feel overwhelmed with tasks, I use Asana to organize my works. And I want to keep it that way.",30/9/2019,"Pros: + t offers all feature any productivity tool can. +Help menu and tutorials are so incredible that it takes only minutes to get the hang of it. +When I create or edit a project, all you need appear in one page. This design help me edit my project most effective way. + I can add task with sub-task, set due date both task and sub-task, add notes, sort them, filter them, assign them to members... and all these stuff can be carried out in one screen. Amazing! + Setting due times for sub-tasks is really important for me, and Asana one of the few software that make it possible. + There are board, list and calendar view options. It is really helpful when creating projects, different each other. + I can view and edit my task in calendar view. + There are well-organized templates to create a project faster. + It is possible to import and export project. No need to waste time when you want to study on a project with different software. + I can to sync projects to calendar and see the task of project I had selected in my calendar. + There are shortcuts for almost all stuff. That makes editing projects even faster. + Even the free version meets all my needs and expectations. Wonderful","Cons: - I want to set priority levels for tasks, and to sort and filter them by priority level. But Asana doesn't provide this. - I really like it is possible to set due dates for sub-tasks, but it would so much better if sub-tasks appeared in calendar view. - Each project has its own calendar but There could be also a main calendar that help users to screen all due dates for all projects and tasks combined. That would make the software so much powerful."
52,52 Asana,Asana,Jade W.,Marketing Coordinator,Civil Engineering,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Excellent tool for project/task/list management”,"Overall: I have been using Asana for both work and personal projects (two separate accounts) for about 6 years now, and I am obsessed. I am constantly thinking of things I need to do for work or personal ideas and business ideas, and it's great for capturing them and organizing them in one place. I make it a habit to cycle through all of my projects once per week to review upcoming deadlines and update the status of projects (sometimes more often). There are some coworkers in other departments who use Asana heavily, but I have not been able to convince my group to use it for collaboration. I would love to get them away from using email, Word docs, and spreadsheets for project collaboration.",19/9/2019,"Pros: Everything! However, I like that it is easy to quickly add tasks and projects, especially from the mobile app. I rarely miss deadlines or forget things since I started using it. It is a great ""container"" for all of your project steps, thoughts, notes, ideas, etc. My life would probably fall apart without it! I use the search feature constantly as well.",Cons: There isn't an easy way (that I know of) to see all items across multiple projects that are due on the same day or week. It's possible that I'm not using it the way the folks at Asana intended.
53,53 Asana,Asana,Connor D.,Founder,E-Learning,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Cliche Warning: Asana Changed My Life”,"Overall: I was introduced to Asana when I started as a new coach for an established executive coaching firm. At the time, I considered myself wildly-unorganized. I'd tried various task-, time-, and priority-management tools in the past and none of them really stuck. Asana was the game-changer for me. I don't know how to explain to beyond the fact that the workflow and systems seem ""natural"" to me. The overall flow seems to match the way my brain best operates, and their features have made tracking everything on my plate (which seems to increase every day) seem almost effortless. I'll be leaving that executive coaching firm shortly as I launch my own business, but I'll definitely be taking my experience with Asana with me. I can't imagine trying to run any aspect of my life, let alone my business, without it.",18/9/2019,"Pros: At the risk of sounding like a super-fan (and honestly, maybe I am), I love almost everything about Asana. But I'd say my all-time favorite feature is the Today, Upcoming, and Later sections. That might sound minor, but that super-simple approach to task, time, and priority-management has been a game-changer for me and my clients. It's allowed me to stay focused on what matters most in-the-moment without losing sight of longer-term vision. Beyond that, the collaboration features are second-to-none. I run every aspect of my business through Asana: Blog posts, client workflows, meetings, presentations, and so on ... Literally everything gets tracked in Asana. And because of that, it makes it very easy to outsource projects and collaborate with others. Finally, another important feature for me has been their Advanced Search feature. Unfortunately they recently removed this from the ""Free"" plan, but it looks like I've been grandfathered in. Honestly, this feature alone is probably worth paying for if you use the tool as extensively as I do. I have literally hundreds of tasks in Asana, split up among various teams, projects, and sections. Managing a database that large without an intuitive search feature would be a nightmare (and, honestly, probably a deal-breaker). Thankfully Asana's Advanced Search functionality doesn't disappoint (and their ""Saved Search"" feature makes it easy to quickly access common searches).","Cons: Two things come to mind: I'm really not a fan of Asana's ""Home"" or ""Inbox"" tabs. Honestly, I don't understand the point of them and find it a little frustrating that the default view is ""Home"" rather than ""My tasks."" Their Home view is a cluttered mess that doesn't give you an insightful or helpful look into your day or your priorities. I ended up creating a custom bookmark straight to the My Tasks view to avoid it. Same goes for Inbox: It's not that I've had a bad experience with their inbox tab, it's just that I don't really understand the point of it. I've never found a viable use case for the Inbox tab after coaching dozens of entrepreneurs through the program."

Useful in free version. It is multifunctional The timeline view facilitates the management of dependencies. This tool helps you prioritize projects and pending tasks. It gives you the ease of seeing what you have worked on and accomplished before to assess progress. This software is truly useful for teams, facilitating the ways for projects to be completed on time. In my experience, Asana solved several problems where I worked as a team, we worked comfortable to give the company full growth. Asana as a project management program gives the function of monitoring dependencies. Be comfortable with larger or larger projects in which the relationships between tasks are more complicated. In my opinion it is a suitable tool for companies to grow larger.",5/9/2019,"Pros:  Pro: It is ideal to organize your work, Asana allows you to plan and structure the work in a comfortable way for you and your work team, in this way help you meet the deadlines, the platform offers you the creation of visual project plans to see how each step is assigned over time . As well as providing you with setting priorities and deadlines, sharing details and assigning tasks, all in a single tool, it is super practical, to progress with your commitments, with it it is much easier to identify risks and eliminate recommended obstacles using custom fields to track the information that is most important for your team or company Even when the plans change, it gives you the opportunity to advance projects and tasks at each stage of the project by giving a report on how your work is going.

(i love the calendar view for my tasks!) it's SUCH a great feeling to check off all the items you have on tap for the day! and it's not just mindless checking off tasks, it's getting me closer to my big goals.",31/8/2019,"Pros: keeps me super organized because i'm a one-woman show and i can't keep it all straight without asana! i love that you can view things on a calendar and sync to your ical or google calendar. i love that you can create different projects and can create subtasks. i don't have a team, but it has tons of great features to assign and keep track of tasks for teams. i check in on my tasks multiple times a day on asana to keep me focused and it has helped me accomplish more than i thought possible. i also love that you have the option to create kanban boards. you can create recurring tasks which is super helpful. i have all of my projects color coordinated and have due dates set so it keeps me super organized. and it's free","Cons: i wish you could switch from list view to kanban view, but you have to select one or the other when setting up a new project. also, since i am a single user, i wish it would automatically assign all tasks to me, but i have to enter it every time. (if you don't assign a task to yourself, it won't show up in ""my tasks"") i check in multiple times a day to my tasks, so i have to make sure i have assigned all the tasks to myself so they show up and don't slip through the cracks. i also wish that when i completed a task, it would be removed from my inbox.

56,56 Asana,Asana,Simon B.,CEO,Management Consulting,2+ years,4,4,5,4,4,9,“An essential tool for our business”,Overall: As a small business that has both internal staff and contractors Asana helps us break projects into tasks and keep track of where we are. It's easy to set up and use which means everybody uses it.,28/8/2019,"Pros: Asana makes both managing projects and product development simple. Dare I say it? Perhaps even a pleasure. A pleasure because of some of the funky features it has - unicorns fly when you complete a task, friendly monsters peek at you over cards. But it's certainly not frivolous. Projects are easy to set up and track. Team members can build a clear view of their work. Admins can report on progress.","Cons: It's a shame you can't assign tasks to two people. And that, in calendar view, you can't rearrange tasks into the order you wish to do them."
57,57 Asana,Asana,Dilanka H.,Software Engineer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,4,5,3,8,“Good and very simple tool to manage your Team and Tasks”,Overall: Asana helped me and my organization in resolving daily issues when assigning and managing tasks over Projects and Teams. We are an IT Service/Development company where the tasks and resource tracking is the base of billing. Asana helped us in tracking tasks in a very good capacity. However it is seen that the lack of customization ability was given a burning problem increased over days with growing requirements.,28/8/2019,Pros: Implementation easiness saved a lot of time. User provision and giving them the access to play with Asana was a great advantage when it came to a full-stacked IT Development Company like us. Simple and elegant design was another plus mark.,Cons: When it came to the day to day functionalities in use users found it little difficult to take the full potential of the assigned tasks because of lack of details captured. Asana should focus on least functionalities to allow end-users (administrators) to customize data/information capturing fields. If the feasibility is there to add some more data driven fields it could have been a great advantage.
58,58 Asana,Asana,Wil S.,Marketing Software Admin,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,9,“Tracking my team and projects has never been easier!”,,26/8/2019,,Cons: The only downfall is that I wish Asana had more options to integrate time tracking as we depend on that to bill our clients. So separating billable from non-billable hours is a must for my company.
59,59 Asana,Asana,Christopher D.,Creative Manager,Real Estate,2+ years,4,5,5,5,4,9,“Workflows for dummies!”,"Overall: Asana is a great platform for designers and marketing teams but may not the perfect solution for more business-finance oriented individuals. Asana feels like an upgraded Basecamp and Zoho with pretty visuals, fun integration, and task/priority management in a nutshell.",7/8/2019,"Pros: Asana's visually engaging and provides an easy at-a-glance view of projects depending on the template you've chosen for a group/project. In addition, its customization allows for easy task management and tailoring to your organizations needs.","Cons: As a newer user, I found that also having too many options made me feel some decision fatigue. I wasn't sure which template to pick but it took some experimenting and onboarding with Asana's team to figure out what worked for my organization. We currently use it for marketing projects internally and it is being used daily which has been helping workloads and making sure that the team is aware of what is going on."
60,60 Asana,Asana,Kylee L.,Marketing Account Executive,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Task organization made simple!”,"Overall: Before we found Asana, we were having difficulties in communicating all project needs, deadlines, and expectations. With 9 members on our marketing team, sometimes details can get lost in the daily shuffle or smaller tasks may be pushed to the bottom of the list to make time for those higher priority projects. As this happened, some projects were getting overlooked and deadlines were missed. Then and there, we decided we needed a platform where the entire team can input projects, deadlines, detailed notes, and expectations. Back and forth communication is key when running a large team, and this has allowed us to give instant feedback and ask questions directly under a specific task. If we do ever need to push out a deadline, you can make changes to any of the tasks/sub-tasks. Then, notifications can be sent out via email or desktop alerts. That notifies any user associated with the task that something on it has been changed. This feature of Asana has also been a major asset to our team. Lastly, the calendar feature, showing all present and future tasks, has been a much needed addition to Asana over the last few years. When we thought Asana couldn't be more streamlined, it upgraded to add in the calendar! Seeing everything in an overall view on the calendar is very helpful, rather than just seeing the tasks laid out in list form. It helps us to see everything in a more ""big picture"" view, so that smaller projects aren't forgotten and deadlines aren't missed.",24/7/2019,"Pros: The best feature of Asana is the ability to share tasks, deadlines, notes, and projects with team members. By linking our entire team on one platform, it has streamlined our review and turnaround process. There are no gaps in communicating what is needed on a project and when its due date is expected. This has been invaluable to our team! You can assign each team member a task, the date it's due, and add notes to clarify things.","Cons: Truly, I cannot think of a single thing we dislike about Asana - the capabilities are exactly what we were looking for. It is easy to use and has updated over the years to match trends and the growing needs of its users."

Unlike other case management/time management software, Asana actually works! Being able to see everything in one place helps me be able to better prioritize my tasks and make sure nothing slips through the cracks.","Cons: This is a very small thing, but one of the only things I have found that I do not enjoy is when I am on my list of tasks I am unable to move all tasks within a Section at once. I can move the Section title, but then I need to move every task individually. I wish I could drag and drop things around in batches."
63,63 Asana,Asana,Beline F.,Event Manager & Marketing Specialist,Events Services,2+ years,5,4,4,,,10,“Wonderful Task Management Software”,,18/7/2019,,"Cons: This is a bit of a technical detail, but we are a sub-unit of several teams, in a college, in a university, and so we share our domain name (@xxxx.edu) with the global university, so we weren't able to get the company style account, rather than a basic premium account, which makes dealing with a ton of projects a bit unruly, and a privacy concern. Our fix was to make all the projects private and only share them with who needs access."

Those VA's have been in the country and out, and Asana has been easy for everyone to work with and communicate via. I have had people suggest other things like Trello, which I have used and have no problems with, but I like the depth and continued simplicity of Asana and have not plans to switch.",11/6/2019,"Pros: It'a tough to pick one thing that I love, but I think if I had to, it's the fact that when I have an annoying to-do list in my head that I know I am going to want to share with a team member or some other contractor I will bring on to help me with something in my business, I can go to Asana to create a list, do a brain dump and add dates and other info as I come up with them. No need to look for paper (as much as I like to write things by hand) and no need to worry about leaving that written list at home the one time I am away from it and want to add to it. Asana is easy to use and has lots of stuff that gets me by as a free user. When I am ready to take on the expense, it will open up even more great features.","Cons: The expense. It's not bad for one person, but I have a little team that I intend to expand. The fee for Asana is per user. It's worth it. I am sure of that, but as a semi-solopreneur who has a few people to help me from time to time and who wants to solidify things so those team members are a definite fixture, I won't look to take on the expense until I know my business can pay for it."
65,65 Asana,Asana,Randall H.,Software Engineer,Defense & Space,2+ years,5,5,5,,4,8,“One of the best task management tools you can get!”,,28/5/2019,,"Cons: I don't really have anything negative to say about Asana as it has been a pleasure to use. I guess even with a simplistic tool like this, there are still people in our team that struggle with the initial learning curve and need training. I think if Asana had some kind of start tutorial where it guided you through the basic functions and provided explanations for each button and where they are located then that might especially help new users."
66,66 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Apparel & Fashion,2+ years,5,5,3,5,5,10,“The most intuitive project management tool!”,Overall:,23/5/2019,"Pros: The interface is easy to navigate, and very intuitive. You can tag team members in comments, assign tasks, re-open tasks, share files and links for approvals. It's complex without ever looking or feeling complex, it just helps teams stay organized and on task. Not to mention it's easy to train new employees on since it's so intuitive! My favorite aspect of all though, is the customizable task lists. As a team leader, it was helpful to customize my lists to keep a pulse on all the projects in my team's queue. As a contributor, each of my team members could organize their action lists however they wanted-due date, priority, etc...","Cons: I wish that the project timeline setup was less manual. If one task's timeline went over, it was a bit manual to update the remaining timeline of all the other tasks in the project."
67,67 Asana,Asana,Santiago A.,Co Editor Chief,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,"“Amazing, powerful and simple, the organizational dream of every team.”","Overall: Having digital platforms, with staff in different parts of the world, it is difficult to group all the work that must be done in one place, since we use Asana as the main organizational element, we managed to reduce errors in attention by 50% of the users and we increase the productivity of the company's departments. It has a lot to do with the way in which we have managed to identify critical nodes and support them among other areas advanced in their goals. Also, we have received from our customers a positive assessment of their requirements.",2/4/2019,"Pros: I have reviewed native applications of big names of the market, that do not finish convincing you, they offer you many promises in functionalities that do not finish concretizing, that is one of the things that I like the most of Asana, it offers you clarity from the first moment, and It gives you at the same time, a simple interface, very powerful and able to get any team to work with the collective work and common goals. In addition, I like that all co-workers can see in digital every progress and achievement achieved of their assigned responsibilities. Also, it has allowed us to be more organized with the meetings and requirements of our clients. As the planning cannot be rigid, thanks to Asana we have identified aspects that can put at risk the global goals of the company, so we have managed to help the department that presents some difficulty. Actually, Asana gives you the full view, it's a genius.","Cons: Entrepreneurs can find in Asana a complete platform and very capable of growing any initiative, that is why I do not identify negative aspects to mention, I have years of use and it is wonderful the ability they have to reinvent themselves in the provision of a service that It looks a lot like wine, it improves with the passage of time."
68,68 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,3,,,8,“A review of Asana by a Creative Director of a Marketing Agency”,"Overall: A very useful - maybe even invaluable - tool for busy workplaces. Decent looking UI and colour scheme, clear lists but not so clear Project Views - not very good for visual people. Annoying notifications - but maybe I should just try and reduce the number of concurrent tasks",20/3/2019,"Pros: There is something very satisfying about having a digital to do list, saved in the cloud, updated automatically and reminding you of key dates, comments and edits. There is something even more satisfying about being able to finally click a little tick button and have an animated unicorn fly across the screen as a reward. It is very useful to be able to keep ALL correspondence relating to a particular task or project in the same thread. This includes text messages, copy, images, PDFs, etc. - all easily downloadable. It's fairly intuitive - looming deadlines are highlighted in red, you can order tasks how you'd like them, you can tag people using the @ symbol like in Gmail and on social media. So, when you are in Asana, all is fine - you can see all your tasks as a list, a project as a whole or separated into Elements. You can even see your team-mate's projects too. Oh, also, adding sub tasks to tasks and sub tasks is very useful. It's not a nice feeling knowing that you can't tick something off your list until it's sub tasks sub tasks have been done, but that's not Asana's fault! It's nice that it emails you to notify you of key events, but this does have a downside. It's good that it ties in with Time Tracking software too.","Cons: So, we have to talk about emails. I, as I'm sure many others do too, have a huge number of tasks assigned to me on Asana. Many of these involve other people - clients, team members, project managers, etc. They all have different deadlines and start dates. Every single action involving you, by default, generates an email. Even after turning many of these notifications off, the Updates folder in my inbox is still so full or notifications, it's very common to miss more important ones. Also, the very fact that there is an Inbox IN Asana itself, means that you are notified of everything twice. This aspect doesn't quite feel right or logical. It also quite frequently logs me out, forcing me to log back in again."

The user interface is very modern and easy to use while the user experience is very well thought out with great micro interactions that make the whole product experience very delightful. It's easy to navigate from one section to another with colored elements to highlight important aspects of the UI. It has useful features like subtasks, boards view and calendar view. You can also view the overall progress per project or team. With the portfolio function, you can view the status of all your current projects in real time, so you can keep everything on track and easily report on progress. They recently added a Gantt chart feature named ""Timeline"" that can help project managers. You can create templates for different tasks and projects, so you and your team can be more efficient. Priority makes it easy to give attention to tasks that need urgent attention. Integration with different services (Slack, Harvest, Dropbox, GitHub, etc) makes Asana be even more helpful. There is also an open API for more sophisticated applications.","Cons: As with all services there is a learning curve to actually becoming proficient in using Asana, but that can be easily accomplished with a bit of time and practice. The only thing I want to mention as a negative is the lack of option to hide team members from the side bar, because they are shown on top of each project. If you are a startup or a small team, and most of the team is on each project, it becomes irrelevant to actually see the same team members again and again. This would make the side menu / list a bit shorter to navigate through."

If I had a magic wand, maybe more free features would be nice. I wish they added a progress bar to your tasks or projects to visiaully better be able to gauge the progress we're making. But it's already a great app."
71,71 Asana,Asana,Michelle M.,Strategic Consultant,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,10,“Long time user”,"Overall: I've been using Asana for years- I think starting in 2010 or 11. I've used it so long that many of my accounts started as the free version and I've watched them slowly and effectively roll out added, useful, functionality without hassle or interruption. I've introduced over 10 nonprofit organizations to using Asana, and everyone has loved it.",4/12/2018,"Pros: Easy to learn, attractive and simple interfaces, easy to make it your daily home base. Great for both new and experienced computer users. I love that you can have task/project-related convos and attachments. This is excellent if you are like me and frequently need to show people where they made decisions in the past in an easy way. I love that events can be recurring on almost every pattern I've ever thought of. I use it for grants tracking, so I can assign out pieces to different team members and easily gather pieces back to me. I love that I can hyperlink to previous years notes, attachments, etc. for easy reference, which is really helpful with donors. I also use it to plan editorial pieces, social media, communications campaigns, nonprofit programs, board meetings, household tasks and chores, etc. Previosuly I used it for large books/projects to break large academic projects into smaller pieces. I've used it with large and small groups aged 18-67. I've set it up for over 10 orgs/groups and it is fast and easy. Everyone loves how easy it is to just start using it. Great email functionality and it has a ton of add-ins you can use to link to other software (like time tracking, invoicing, etc.) I LOVE ASANA.","Cons: I love their free version with a firey passion, but once downside is as they have grown, the free version has lost some searching/reporting capability. However, using their paid product gets you everything you could want. So if you are piloting the free version to get a sense, there is a lot more out there."
72,72 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,3,4,,4,7,"“An Organizational, Team Coordination and Tracking Tool”","Overall: In a large team who are decentralized (different departments handling different tasks within the same project), the tool works well to coordinate each team and meet deadlines. It also minimizes the hassle of follow up for team leads.",11/9/2018,"Pros: Key pros that elevate my overall experience in regards to the software are: 1. User interface and design - The design aspects are very colorful and interactive, making it easy to navigate from one part of the application to another 2. The timeline feature and ability to monitor other team members' progress on common or interrelated tasks enables the overall team to be efficient and helps with easy follow up 3. The ability to create tasks, project templates, color coded calendars and visual project plans not only adds to the user experience (UX) but also to enhance efficiency as one progresses through the project timelines and goals 4. The software is efficient in updating what's in progress, complete, new requests, all of which assist the user to manage their goals for a project. Priority levels also increase efficiency because a user can also give more attention to high priority tasks. 5. On the technical side, it has an open API and integrates well with other software applications such as dropbox and GitHub 6. Asana recently added gantt chart functionality called timelines which helps with project dependencies","Cons: 1. It takes some time to learn how to use each feature of the product as there are so many features. It requires someone who already has some knowledge to be able to guide other team members. They are easy to use once you do work on them, but some users struggle with more specific features such as dashboards, communication tools. 2. It does not have an in-built instant messaging/chat feature to chat instantly with team mates although they have options to integrate with other softwares for the same functionality. 3. There are too many details that need to be added by users, taking away slightly from the overall experience"
73,73 Asana,Asana,Adam H.,Engineer,Civil Engineering,2+ years,4,5,4,,5,9,“Great Tool for Progress Tracking and Group Collaboration”,"Overall: We have been able to streamline group organization and collaboration into a single source. Asana has helped to keep current lists of project related tasks, and ensure team members are aware of, and completing tasks by the given completion target dates. Asana has also helped to reduce email clutter caused from frequent 'back and forth' emails for small comments between team members by providing a single location to comment on, and update statuses of tasks.",30/8/2018,"Pros: The excellent user interface provides for a clean and organized way to add tasks to your list, edit tasks, and cross tasks off when completed. As I primarily use this software for business purposes for collaboration with team members within my office, it is a one-stop-shop that has eliminated paper checklists, sticky notes, and ""to-do"" lists, by combining all of these in a slick web interface. The ease of use results in frequent task updates which can be viewed and commented on by the entire team, ensuring tasks are not missed or forgotten. As I am often working on many projects simultaneously throughout the week, the convenience of adding new projects and tasks to individual projects is extremely helpful to stay organized, view all of the pending tasks, and schedule time accordingly based on completion dates you have inputted for each task. Another great feature is linking emails to certain projects in Asana; a quick copy of the URL for the project in the platform, and you can easily send emails and attachments directly into Asana for effortless filing. As a free software, Asana is an excellent tool to use for group collaboration, or for personal use to make sure you are effectively managing checklist, tasks and projects.","Cons: The major downside to Asana used in a working environment is that tasks can't be assigned priorities, which can result in frequent check-ins on the list to ensure you are prioritizing tasks properly. A color-coded priority method would be extremely helpful in elevating high priority tasks above the rest. As Asana is a cloud-based software, latency can sometimes be an issue resulting in a delay in typing and moving between projects and tasks, though this is only a minor convenience."

I also really like being able to assign users are contributors or comment-only. That has been helpful when working with clients who get a little overzealous with their task assigning. Obviously the look and feel are great - it's very intuitive to someone who uses collaborative tools (ie. similar to Basecamp). I also love the drag and drop file archive - we use this feature even more than Dropbox because all aspects of the project can live in one place. The more I can keep my team in this system working, and finding what they need independently, the better.","Cons: Not being able to assign the same task to two people is a pain. I don't want to duplicate the task because that clutters up my project space and can cause confusion (esp when I have a ton of moving parts). . So the option to have two people responsible for the same task would be ideal. I've had issues with the dependency feature as well. It's not super intuitive - though it's a feature I'd like to use because I'd like to trigger team members to start on certain work once a task is completed - it would make my job as the Sr. PM easier. Maybe blowing out the dependency functionality is something to look into. One thing I hear ALOT from clients and team members is accessing links from their Asana email notifications. They will click a link and be taken to just that specific task, but they don't understand where that task lives because the project tags aren't obvious enough. If the links could open up the full project with the list or kanban view on the left, and the open task on the right, that would be hugely helpful. Resourcing is a huge issue for our company so I would love to see something about resource management implemented in the future. I would pay double to have a solid resourcing/traffic view in Asana."

Asana has been the closest we've found to what we are looking for. We can add sub-contractors on individual projects and assign them tasks without having to pay an arm and a leg. This platform would be dynamite with a couple additional features and small changes, but regardless, it has still been of great benefit to us. It is simple enough (compared to complex tools like Bitrix24) but dynamic enough (compared to simple tools like Trello) to be our main work space hub. Because we are used to using free and unlimited tools (like Bitrix24 and Trello), we like that Asana is an affordable solution. We are grateful for all of the benefit it has added to our company",10/8/2018,"Pros: Asana has been a huge asset to our company! It's is very easy to use, clean, organized, aesthetically engaging, and customizable enough to fit specific needs of unique organizations. To create a task list, you must create a new project, so we have a unique ""project"" for each employee, simply as a way of putting their personal to do list in Asana, instead of having a separate platform (like Wunderlist) for general tasks. Now all project tasks and general tasks can be viewed in one list in Asana. Asana works with our time tracking platform (Toggl) so employees don't have to shift between windows to track which project they are working on. The Timeline view was the biggest selling point for us, since the simple Trello-like project view is far too basic for the complexities of our many fast moving projects. Asana Timeline is simple enough that we don't waste valuable hours just getting the project timeline setup (templates is a life-saver), but we also don't waste time duplicating work, retracing steps, dividing tasks via email, etc. It keeps us organized and helps us communicate progress quickly.","Cons: Asana allows you to chat around any project, however, the notifications for new messages do not get your attention! You have to be in Asana or email no-stop to realize someone has written you. This makes the conversation/chat element near useless for us. We have to put our messages in Asana (so we can keep all project information in one place) but then notify the associated colleague in What's App that they have a pending and time sensitive message in Asana. This is frustrating! There are a handful of other elements that make this platform less than it could be. When you add a task with a due date and due time, you will not receive an overt chime or pop-up notification at the due time. Again, you must be constantly checking email or Asana... very inefficient with numerous projects going at once and for employees with lots of emails coming in throughout the day. Additionally, you cannot designate a default ""assign to"" person for a particular task/project list. These issues have been brought up by many Asana users and even after lots of time passing, there has not been real resolution to these frustrating elements."
76,76 Asana,Asana,Valerie T.,Virtual Assistant,Unspecified,2+ years,5,4,4,4,,,“Full-featured task manager with one notable flaw”,,10/6/2018,,"Cons: Asana has one big flaw that even the paid account doesn't address. You can't see ALL of your tasks in one place. Asana is organized into Workspaces and within those, Projects. Within each Workspace, you can view MyTasks to see all the tasks assigned to you from all the projects within THAT workspace. But if you have multiple workspaces (ex. a client shares their workspace with you), there is no way to see all the tasks assigned to you from all workspaces. Literally no way. No workarounds I've tried work, no chrome extensions, nothing. There are tons of requests for this feature in the Asana community, but for whatever reason - they just don't offer this feature. Take note Asana devs - if you would just fix this one issue, Asana would be very close to perfect for a lot of people. Fix this one issue, and a bunch of those people who are using other tools might come on back to you."
77,77 Asana,Asana,Connie H.,Director of Marketing Resources Support,Government Administration,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,10,“Effective project management”,"Overall: Our Marketing team used the free version of Asana for over 5 years and really made it work for them to the point that we adopted it as an organization and purchased the pro version. We've been adding projects and it's now feeling cluttered, but I think that's just a process issue. I would recommend having clear guidelines on what constitutes a project and a routine for archiving projects to keep things clean from the onset.",5/6/2018,"Pros: Users don't have to be experts to get started with adopting this tool, but also has many advanced-level features and integrations. A ""con"" I turned into a ""pro"" through Asana's good knowledgebase was learning how to set up projects in Excel (allowing copy/paste and search/replace functionality for repetitive series of tasks) and importing into Asana as a new project -- initially they were taking too long. It's very easy to assign/change tasks in bulk. We have the Pro version and love the functionality of custom fields (although a con is that you only see the latest custom fields created by anyone and there's no controls so it can turn into inconsistencies or duplication of efforts.) Support was good and account manager used an onboarding template to outline our steps to help acclimate us.","Cons: There are ways to control email notifications within each project (or turn off completely), but in spite of training, I still struggle with that as I set up new projects and getting enough, but not too many, reminders. Subtasks are great to hide granular-level items or breakdown a single task to multiple users, but they're not automatically assigned to the parent project of the task they're created under. Notifications don't include the parent project name and the task isn't always clear when taken out of context."
78,78 Asana,Asana,Cindy B.,Closeout Specialist & HR Administrator,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana Changed Our Entire Workflow”,"Overall: It makes my job much easier. It helps office staff be more self-directing, and it keeps us organized on our management team.",21/5/2018,"Pros: It's accessible from my phone or my desktop. I have several ways of accessing my ""to do list"" now - I keep on top of my work and projects I'm even peripherally involved in via the inbox. I can filter to just ""my tasks"" or I can specifically choose a project and view all of its tasks. I can check out the calendar view to see what's going on with a broad look, or I can view individual tasks and all of the subtasks to manage them at a narrower scope. This app connects our management team, some of whom are almost always in the field, so that we can all work together. It's practically eliminated the need for internal emails. We love it. It keeps all of our information relevant, quickly-accessible, and current. Everyone has the most updated news on all of the projects he or she is involved in, so it makes everything move much more quickly, especially in invoicing and business development. One company I work for uses the free version, and I freelance for a company who uses the paid version. It's free or inexpensive, and it works wonders. I like it better than any of the competitors I've tried. The customer service and development teams are pretty transparent and active on their user forums, so that's a plus, too.","Cons: The only thing that I don't like is that once you pick a format for a project, it can't be changed. You can choose to have project organized as a list or as a ""board"" (think of it like a page full of sticky notes). I have one project that has gotten a lot bigger since I created it, and it would be much better managed at this point as a list, but I'll have to replace it with a list-based project in order to do that. Not a deal-breaker, but definitely should be an option. They're aware of it, and it's on their priority list. I just can't wait til it's released."
79,79 Asana,Asana,Brice W.,Managing Director,Management Consulting,2+ years,4,5,3,5,5,9,“Great tool for small team and project management”,"Overall: Don't try to talk anyone into Asana! I have found the successful launches are as follows 1. Its your team and you will only work through Asana and its just what it is. ( not the best feeling roll out, but I have never not had a team member come around one day and have a list of..did you knows about Asana features) 2. When someone is talking through an issue they are having that you know Asana could easily solve politely build the project bones right then and there and car sell them (wouldn't it be great if you had a tool that could show you... or how easy would your job be if you could always find the document xx emailed to you for project....) and when the head is nodding flip your screen towards them and be like ""would it look something like this? 3. Just start using it and start rocking your job and when people start to wonder how you have organized your life and work in such a short period of time. tell them you aren't sharing your secret or your secret software... and I'll be damned if they don't all figure out what you are using and just plan adopt it and them come back around like they are some sort of secret tech agent that figured out your secret and cannot believe you were holding this back from them....even though you had a 3 month internal adoption campaign for it earlier in the year...*head shake*",27/4/2018,"Pros: Asana is a very easy to pick up software. I stumbled across it while on the search for something to help me stay on top my teams progress on the multitude of small to medium size projects they were involved in at our company. At the time my team was struggling to organize the fire drill level projects that seemed to be dropped off in person, emailed, or communicated through a variety digital outlets all day every day. A the time I was wasting time trying to help the five year old organization dial in on a communication method and project management philosophy. Having no luck trying to fix the problem company-wide I turned inward for a tool to help our team. Asana was exactly what we needed. The two biggest function i used right out of the gate were To do list and Email forward to task (forward any email into Asana through either a general email or a project specific email - whoever you put in the [To] becomes the owner of the task [CC] becomes a follower [subject] is the task title [body] becomes the task description. So many executives would just email me all day long with things that specific people on my team took care of, before Asana I had to email it to them and then keep a list of items to remember to follow up on and to follow up with the executive to make sure they got the response or service they were looking for. Enter Asana - Same as before I forward the email along adding the Asana email, big difference is now I have a digital list of what tasks I have forwarded on, can see the solution provided, can see the response from the executive, and get to sleep at night when my team member checks it of as done and it clears from my assigned to others list. Also helped with repeat questions as the executive team started to see the change in our department they slowly started to adopt Asana for themselves and their teams. Onvce they started interacting through Asana we stopped getting common repeat questions because as soon as they would start typing it the system would pull up previous items and ask if any of these were relevant to their question. Win Win, less emails, people empowered to have the answers they need without needing to file every communication themselves, only have to follow up on tasks I've assigned out when I get the ""hey should someone have done something with this"" pop up when the system feels like a task is going longer than usual. Also connects with ... nearly everything","Cons: The dashboards are very basic. You are better off tracking larger projects between a three way Asana, Instagant, Harvest integration. It is great that you can create templates for larger projects or tasks that reoccur so you don't have to rebuild it every time, but its a pain that you cant have the people who do the task assigned to the template. you can but then they get blown up with reminders and end up spending time searching for to-do's that are not real because its in the template."
80,80 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Pharmaceuticals,2+ years,4,5,3,4,4,10,"“Easy to use, great for accountability”",Overall: Our company has increased our ability to provide clients with deliverables. We have been able to say we meet deadlines. We also have not sacrificed quality and have been given the ability to focus on that rather than focusing on tasks/timelines.,28/3/2018,"Pros: It works for both my visually creative people and my operational people. It allows ease of mind for myself when assigning tasks to others. It's also easy to use for those who aren't ""tech savvy"" or who struggle with learning new things. They provide a lot of insight into how to use/customize the software for your organization. Having implemented it across my organization in the ""premium"" version, we have found ourselves more organized, more goal focused, and are no longer worried about remembering the details. It's all there for us. Very happy with the future updates coming out to make it less marketing/sales oriented with abstracts to more process oriented and operational-ized without losing the ease-of-use features. We use it primarily for HR (training, onboarding) and our Client Projects (keeping track of tasks and deliverables while keeping an eye on due dates). We have just implemented it into Marketing/Sales and we maintain about 75% compliance.","Cons: It was hard to find information on the premium version in a way that showed me exactly what it did. Eventually, a person contacted me by email and provided me with a webinar, but I couldn't find the same webinar on their site which was a little frustrating. Their customer support has gotten better, but it still needs a little work (chat is great, but would love a dedicated account director). Still lacks features that other PM software has which I would like. I know it's coming soon though. I rated lower on Features/Functionality and Value for Money because I think those go hand in hand. The Free version was fine for us except I wanted more. If there were more features I think it would be more worth the money. As it stands, you could take or leave the premium version. Among peers, I usually recommend the Free version and implementing that before moving towards the Premium version. I did that for about 6 months before committing to Premium."
81,81 Asana,Asana,Sarah M.,Marketing Strategist,11-50 employees,2+ years,4,4,3,4,,,"“Overall, asana is incredibly flexible, but that can also be it's downfall”",,27/3/2018,,"Cons: There's too much flexibility. Even with templates set up, everyone sets up task lists differently, so no two projects are the same. Unless you implement a rigid system or process around how employees should build out a project and task lists, or have only a few people allowed to create tasks, it can easily get confusing. This makes it hard to find things. Thank god for the search bar, but when you can't remember exactly what you named something, it's difficult to track things down. It's also hard to know where a project is at by looking in asana. All tasks you've completed are hidden by default. I sometimes turn on their visibility so I can at least see what has been completed and what's left, but it's not a great picture of how far along the project actually is, as there are sometimes tasks that either haven't been entered yet, or tasks that contain large lists of subtasks, so even though it looks like one task, there's actually 12 steps to it. Basically, the task list doesn't give you any indication of how much time is estimated that each tasks needs to complete. It's really easy to get lost with subtasks inside of subtasks inside of subtasks."
82,82 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,51-200 employees,2+ years,4,5,4,3,,8,“In a perfect position between ease of use and features”,Overall: There aren't many freemium applications around where the free version really meets basic needs until a project or team got enough velocity to justify paying for its premium options. Asana blows many others out of the water in this aspect.,9/3/2018,"Pros: Call me crazy but I first started using Asana as a sort of advanced to-do list a few years ago. After trying out many applications specifically designed for that purpose but never finding the amount of control which I wanted, I looked into ""project management"" apps and that's how I bumped on Asana. Without prior knowledge of the product, I found my way around within minutes. The free version of Asana did exactly what I needed (and more). I could finally manage my tasks in boards, combine them in lists, assign labels, assign to my relatives, quickly mark a task as completed on my phone or add a new task via the same app. Only recently I started developing the need to use Asana for what it was originally built: actual project management. For now it does the job well, for our small projects in a rather small team. Sure, the tool isn't as advanced as some other project management tools, but I definitely wouldn't call Asana ""basic"", as it really offers a bunch of handy features. Where Asana excels is balancing on a thin line between offering just enough features and keeping everything fast, intuitive and user-friendly.","Cons: Real-time, two-way Google Calendar synchronisation is a must and has been an open feature request by many users for more than a year. For bigger projects requiring specifics and cooperation with other teams we still rely on other, similar software. I'm not sure if Asana would get the job done here."
83,83 Asana,Asana,Grace D.,Lab Manager,Higher Education,2+ years,4,4,4,4,,,"“EXCELLENT task management, but not worth paying for Premium features. ”",,4/1/2018,,"Cons: Premium features are not worth . They don't significantly improve the functionality, and are not worth going. The only draw is the free account only allows 15 members. ASANA should offer a cheaper subscription for teams who just need more than 15 members, but are not interested in the cost of the premium features. Here are some things that need work 1 Can't assign a task to more than one person (huge drawback) 2 Communicating on ASANA isn't the best. Most teams also use messaging services, like Slack for all communication. For us this has been a problem, because sometimes we can't remember where a certain conversation took place, on Slack or ASANA. It would be nice to have ASANA fully integrated with a messaging platform, so conversations about projects are in one or both places. 3 The calendar is honestly confusing. Always unsure if I add a due date to a task, if it will show up in the calendar or not-not very intuitive. Also, calendar should have different views for personal task dates, and team dates. 4 Files added to tasks are dead, meaning if you edit the file you need to upload the new version. It would be nice to have it integrated with cloud services so the file auto updates. 5 Can't communicate between tasks/projects on other workspaces or be able to copy a project to a new workspace. 6 Board view can get cluttered, so having projects within projects could help with larger projects."

Currently the display (of projects and task lists) is fairly inflexible, but, it's very easy to use. Asana does not have gantt charts or any micro level management tools used for budgeting, which is why I recommend using Asana for the communication and deadline aspect of projects, but NOT for carrying out PM responsibilities required for most successful projects."

Because the free version is limited to 15 users, we've integrated this with Atlassian's HipChat, which we received as a grant. Combined, this has been an excellent management, tracking, file sharing and centralized communications tool in an organization where people work on various platforms with different software. This has been a bit of a tough sell to folks used to working with desktop email and Outlook systems, but Asana works well on mobile devices. It also centralizes all information in a searchable database, which has proven enormously useful. However, there is a significant learning curve with Asana, which has hampered our roll-out efforts. Asana's complexity and wide feature set can be overwhelming for the uninitiated.",8/12/2016,"Pros: Centralized project management, file sharing and search functions save a lot of time and effort by reducing the need to use email. The searchable archive has been very helpful. Overall, Asana has made project work much more efficient by keeping all relevant parties in the loop, all conversations in one place, and enabling file sharing across all devices and platforms.","Cons: Asana's feature set and complexity requires a relatively steep learning curve for the uninitiated. That hampered roll-out efforts in my organization, along with the fact there is no desktop app for Asana. After nearly a year, I'm still figuring out all the features and best uses, so it would be nice to have a variety of case studies/examples from which to glean best practices."
87,87 Asana,Asana,Cambria H.,"Previously, Advancement Marketing Specialist",Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“An Asana Love Letter”,"Overall: I LOVE Asana! It is one of my favorite apps on my phone and helps me keep myself sane. I never worry about forgetting to do anything because I just put it on my Asana and then don't have to even think about it until I check my tasks. I first started using in several years ago as a way to keep track of tasks at in my job, and then transitioned it to using it with my team in the office. We were working on several large projects with a lot of moving parts and it helped us all keep our heads on straight. During really busy and stressful seasons at work, Asana was a crucial part of reducing stress as much as possible. I would frequently wake up in the middle of the night thinking about all the things I or my teammates had to do - but all I had to do was put it on my Asana and assign it to the appropriate teammates and I was able to fall back asleep. I recently began an intensive full-time 10-month master's program that is CRAZY in terms of schedule and workload. There are a lot of group projects and one of the first things I did was get my whole group on Asana to help us keep our heads on straight. It was working so well for my group that several other groups asked me to show them how it worked. I love the seamless transition between app and desktop, and all the features of Asana. The ability to set specific due date times and recurring tasks are some of my favorite features. The unicorns and narwhals are also a fun feature and make checking a task off my list just that much more rewarding. Thanks, Asana, for such a wonderful product and for continually seeking to improve the design and functionality of the site. I don't know where I would be without you",10/11/2016,Pros: The ease of use and specific customizable features for each task.,"Cons: I love almost everything about it!

88,88 Asana,Asana,Blanca C.,Marketing Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,4,5,4,9,“I love Asana but some features could be more user friendly”,"Overall: I use Asana to manage all of my marketing client projects. I really love it and recommend it to many. One of the things that was missing were dependencies. Now that the Asana team has created them, I try to use them everywhere but building the dependencies on re-occuring task (with a list of subtasks) is VERY tedious. It would be great if the feature had a drag and connect option to build dependencies. The way it is right now takes so much time to go in and click on every subtask that is dependent on the one before. Or even having the ability to copy dependencies when making a copy of a task so that the new task's subtasks already have all of the subtask dependencies built when copied over.",10/11/2016,Pros: Sleek and user friendly interface. Mobile App and offline mode work very well. Love the continued development of new features and integrations. Looking forward to using Asana with Slack once I get the hang of it.,"Cons: I was so excited about these dependencies and while I'm still happy I can use them, the process of assigning them is SO manual and tedious. I run multiple client projects on Asana and some of these clients have re-occuring processes where building dependencies EVERY SINGLE TIME we replicate a task with a list of subtasks just takes up more time than I have. Ability to copy dependencies just like other info when duplicating a task.. OR even better, ability to click on a subtask and drag a connection to the subtask before it that it's dependent on. Example: Email flow for a client. Our contract of seeing out 20 emails in 8 months. Each email and topic is it's own task but the process to get the email out is built into subtasks and the same for each task. Since the whole project is run by contract free-lancers, dependency notifications when something is done is a great feature but we have to go in and build/connect dependencies for 120 subtasks if each main task (email) has 6 subtasks. Also connecting dependencies to flow into Instagantt. I know they had dependencies before Asana but now using Instagantt means DOUBLE dependency work if we want Asana dependencies to be reflected on Instagantt."
89,89 Asana,Asana,Brad M.,CEO,1-10 employees,2+ years,4,1,2,3,3,2,“Massive learning curve; inconsistent concepts”,"Overall: A lot of asana is neat. But I have so many pain points. To illustrate this, look how many help videos you have. I don't think a product like this should require someone to sit down and watch 15 videos. Difficult to grasp. I've had collaborators I've invited in persevere with it then tell me ""I'm sorry, I hate asana"". Eg the 'inbox'. They can see parts of a conversation, so it looks just like the task's own thread except all their own contributions are missing. Suggest you make the inbox view much leaner. Eg2 conversations. With the various people I've worked with it's been more confusion, at least initially I'm still not clear on who sees what and who gets notified of what when there are teams and people direct on projects. And having to assign someone to a project after removing them, so that I can unprovision them? That was awkward When I went to a billed plan, my scheduled webex/gotomeeting session was a no show The space distribution of the ui is out. Why when I close the left projects pane does the list view (left) pane take up more than half the width of the screen, leaving not much for the actual details?? My main screen is Mac laptop, 1280x800 but it's the same on 1920x1080 where the list pane should be much narrower than the detail The tool gears itself to power users by requiring memorising hot keys for formatting, no buttons for new users. In itself this is ok, but then it's too basic because it doesn't support hyperlinks. Hyperlinks. Like from the 1990's. Just put in markdown support please Because of the formatting limits the knowledge base I want to set up is crippled. We're used to Confluence in the past and am poised to move that content over to Confluence If I have a task nested 2 tasks deep, I have to move it to the project, then back down into the other parent I want it in. How about a copy dock somewhere I can put it while I'm moving or something? Do folk get notified of new task when I move a task to project level? Where's my 'recently viewed' list? Navigating and searching are sloow, maybe not in a SF office, but elsewhere. I'd like quick view drop down of stuff I've viewed lately and favorited tasks Sorry to bitch about this. It has nice features. To be honest probably part of our problem is we're not all fulltime on this, so the learning curve for them takes longer to overcome. But getting externals to jump in and do certain bits is useful for us, so as it is now, if I was starting over, I wouldn't use asana",4/11/2016,,

Asana has been a great way to get my thoughts down and to work the way I want to. As a free solution, it has been the best thing for our team to work together, share tasks, and see everyone's progress on projects both large and small. I really like the flexibility of the app in assigning tasks to others on your team, the quick-to-use keyboard shortcuts that increase your productivity, and the mobile app so you can stay up-to-date across your devices. Being able to create different teams of people and projects as well as seeing the progress in those tasks is a huge help. I also really like the different views (list, calendar, attachments) and the various ways you can sort them (by due date, by assignee, etc.) so you can find just what you're looking for. Another huge help is the ability to attached files from other services like Dropbox and Google Drive.",30/6/2015,,"Cons: While the task list is very flexible, it can be a little difficult to understand on first-use. For example, being able to add sections is a great way to organize and group tasks, but it may be a little difficult for a new user to figure out. While you can find out how to do a lot of things in the shortcuts menu or by watching the tutorial videos, it could be nice to have a short, interactive tutorial that just walks you through a some fundamental items in a few steps that you can click through and try. I think that would be a great way to help new users get accustomed to the tool and learn how to use it more quickly."

I love how the interface is set up - very user friendly and easy to use.","Cons: I don't like that it auto-loads your project view - I'd prefer it stayed as the previous setting. Perhaps there is a way to set it that I haven't tried though. Aside from that, haven't encountered anything that I don't like."
92,92 Asana,Asana,Tonico C.,Director,Writing and Editing,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Professional Comunicate and Co-working Modern Tool.”,"Overall: I use Asana to create writing projects for my self. With the features of Asana, I manage my own time on this writing project. Asana is a simple and helpful app to you and to your business to achieve his goals. The modern world of teamwork needs a tool to manage your teammate's deadlines and progress in the same app. With Asana, you will be able to share details, links, images, and ideas in a private and professional environment, all this for free. For this reason, I believe Asana is a great partner to my business, and it is also helpful to any company in the world.",18/8/2020,"Pros: I use Asana because it has a connection directly to my Google Drive on my android smartphone, with this functional feature I can access my files in the cloud, and with these features, I save many gigabytes of space in my devices. Also, I can put links in the project to my team get access to edit files direct on Google Drive. Asana speed up the process of design thinking of our company and our services projects. The free trial version has everything you need to start to manage your workgroup. The features of Asana gives professionals tools to help your business manage projects and teamwork with the benficity of link all kindy of files and content online with Asana. Keep everything you need together to comunicate and co-working with your team is essential to any business who wants to enjoys the growing effects of one brainstorm.","Cons: I have a suggestion to Asana: When I open the camera in the app on my device does not have the option to record videos. The camera function only has the capture picture function. I believe record video is one feature to add in the Asana app because, with video record, we can create lessons and tutorials for our team. I also recommend lives transmission features on Asana to show our work environment to our teammates, when this be necessary. However, in Asana, you can upload links of your online video platform in your project without difficulty, but the native feature in the Asana app will be one improvement applauded for all users of Asana. For this reason, I believe Asana has the potential to add these features and grow our partnership with their company."
93,93 Asana,Asana,Jordan L.,Manager of Campaign Operations,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,10,“Asana has been a game changer for me and my colleagues for over 2+ years!”,"Overall: Creating projects, tasks, and processes through Asana to ensure current and new Google & Facebook ad account launch and maintained for consistency, efficiency, and the prevention of errors for quality assurance.",24/6/2020,Pros: Asana has not only streamlined our workflows and tasks but also our communication between teams with a whole another level of organized and tracking. Getting away from email is one of the best moves you could do for a team within an office space or remotely as our team is. Tasks with assignees and due dates give accountability to co-workers involved but also visibility to other teams and managers. I even love to use their mobile app for one-off ideas for tasks to investigate when I'm back at my computer or even to reply to someone to keep the ball rolling on a project.,"Cons: Honestly, this is the hardest question because usually when I find myself with an issue Asana training guides or support usually resolve our needs. Maybe an option where we can add seats for one user/seat at a time and not have to buy in sets of 5 or more."
94,94 Asana,Asana,Svetla M.,Marketing manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,"“Very easy to use task management system, worked perfect for an entirely remote team”","Overall: With Asana it is very easy to manage multiple projects, even such that involve the customer for misc tasks. Progress is easy to follow, and comments and updates are convenient to receive via email notifications. The interface is very intuitive and even customers didn't have any issues with getting familiar with it.",25/5/2020,"Pros: Easy to use, even for customers who are working with task management software for their first time, easy to set up permissions, assign tasks, get notifications. The reply via email is a very useful feature, especially when you are on the go. Worked great when we had to handle a big number of customer projects simultaneously.",Cons: The format of email notifications when an update on a card happens can be improved
95,95 Asana,Asana,Bill B.,Owner,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Excellent project management for sole proprietors”,"Overall: While Asana emphasizes teams, I've found it the best tool available for my one-person business. I use it as a daily calendar, project planner, notepad and for reminders. Items can be viewed and manipulated in a variety of ways - as a calendar, a list, a Kanban board, or a timeline.",9/4/2020,"Pros: Asana integrates with many other web apps and has a good API. Asana remains free for one user, which I appreciate.","Cons: The mobile app would be nicer if it remembered your choices about views and sort orders. The default view on opening the app isn't useful to me. Every time I open, I have to select sort by due date."
96,96 Asana,Asana,Heather Y.,co-founder,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,9,“Tried and true. Keeps us accountable. ”,Overall:,13/3/2020,"Pros: ASANA is feature-rich with the flexibility that allows for both list and visually driven people to stay on task and get things done. The numerous APIs available helps integrate ASANA to various other platforms easily. We use Slack and ASANA almost as one entity at this point. I personally use the Kanban-style tiles when creating projects and found the ability to drag and drop to be immensely helpful. We have tried other software like Trello, Airtable, etc. but come back to ASANA because of it's the ease of use and reliability.","Cons: I found the I wish the Calendar was more robust, I would like to be able to move due dates, etc as a drag and drop feature on the calendar but it's not available. Also, when creating the titles on the tiles I found it not to be intuitive and end up having to click multiple times to get it right."
97,97 Asana,Asana,Louis W.,Lead Web Developer,Internet,2+ years,5,4,5,5,4,8,“Project Management For Any Project”,Overall: We use it for managing client projects. We use it for managing internal projects. We use it for brainstorming. We store non-sensitive data that the whole team needs to have quick access to utilize. You name it. It is our swiss army knife. It has been a great tool for organizing our business.,3/1/2020,"Pros: It has grown over the years to become incredibly versatile. Initially, it started with a list view. Perfect for me. I love lists. Then they added card views like some competitors have utilized. Depending on the project a card view may be ideal. They now have a timeline and Gantt style options as well. This is incredibly valuable for managing long projects with multiple team members and milestones. The software has matured in a way that has allowed us to have a great solution/layout for any size/complexity of project.","Cons: All of the many features can now make the software daunting for new employees/clients to grasp. They do have a wealth of ""getting started"" literature. The core issue is that a significant time commitment is required to grasp every facet of the tool."
98,98 Asana,Asana,Joshua M.,Process Optimization Analyst,Printing,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,8,“An Extremely Useful Strategic Planning and Project Management Platform!”,Overall:,8/4/2019,"Pros: I am on a team that tests potential software rollouts in my organization. Asana is a tool that we have been rolling out to project management and sales teams. So far, I have personally enjoyed the user interface and ability to track assign specific users to tasks. I see Asana as being most beneficial to small to medium-sized teams that span different geographical locations. Task and schedule organization works well and allows project teams to collaborate on goals and deadlines. One of my favorite features is the ability for multiple users to collaborate on project specific tasks without wiping out progress from other users. Furthermore, the presentation is extremely clean, which helps keep projects at the forefront for the user. Asana has had some of the best internal feedback among our own project team as well.","Cons: There is not a lot of customization with regard to the access levels for multiple users. Furthermore, task owners will have difficulties adding or deleting tasks without approval from supervisors. In addition to this, there is not a great working record of the steps in a project that have been added or deleted. It would be nice to keep a working history of a document in order to revert to previous versions. This can be especially painful for larger projects that require multiple stakeholders over a long amount of time."
99,99 Asana,Asana,Billy B.,Creative Director,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,"“You need Asana, thank me later.”","Overall: Asana has made a positive impact on my work life. It keeps our Marketing department on-track and very organized. It is a great product that would be useful to any team, project, business, etc.",4/4/2019,"Pros: With my role, I have a multitude of projects everyday with crucial due dates. I work with 10-20 different co-workers at any given time and needed a simplified way to manage everything I'm working on in one place - my email inbox was not cutting it. Asana solved my problem. Now, co-workers create Tasks with all the information and dates needed, I'm immediately notified and I can then plan my day, week, quarter, etc. I have dedicated one monitor solely to Asana. It's so now part of my daily routine and has become so important to me. Asana keeps me on track, allows for project collaboration and statuses to keep everyone in the know. One of the best parts of my day is when I mark a Task as completed. Not only does it feel good to clean up the list of projects, but a fun animation happens to celebrate the achievement - I love those types of things","Cons: The only feature I wish it had was the ability to mark certain dates as not available - meaning, If I am out of the office on vacation, I would like to disable those dates from being selected by co-workers when creating Tasks. This feature would save us time from having to edit due dates on Tasks at a later time, and also alert my co-workers immediately that those dates are not available so they can plan around it."
100,100 Asana,Asana,Patricia S.,Writer & Designer,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,4,5,,,7,“Don't Reinvent the Wheel - Use Asana”,"Overall: Our team uses Asana to manage collaborative projects, as well as individual to-dos, and even to work with contractors outside our organization. It's reassuring to have a shared process around a standard platform. Whenever we start a project, Asana is the first place we go to document our timelines and assign out responsibilities. It will become your one-stop shop for juggling your tasks and finishing your work on time.",22/2/2019,"Pros: Asana is the project management software you probably don't know you need. Sure, you can keep your to-do list in Microsoft Word for years like I did, but that doesn't help you get your work done. Asana does. I can keep personal to-do's as well as team lists, work within projects, get notified on my progress, and - best of all - use emojis. There's even a mystical celebration unicorn you may see from time to time when checking off tasks! There's no reason to reinvent the wheel and try to get a bunch of different platforms working together. Asana offers integrations with Dropbox, Google Drive, and tons of others.","Cons: The only thing that's depressing about Asana is seeing how much you have to do! For some, the red overdue tasks and inbox you can never quite clear out completely may be too much to handle. But there's always the mystical hope that someday the list will be short and the inbox empty (I actually have seen it, it's possible!) For some on our team, it was hard to get used to the navigation of multiple expanding panes, and if you have too many projects it may be hard to handle, but that's nothing you can't overcome with training."
101,101 Asana,Asana,Stacey L.,President,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,4,4,4,10,“Asana is a flexible task manager for managing projects of all sizes”,"Overall: Asana is a practical project management tool that is easy for all users to learn. If all you need is a simple checklist, then Asana won't overwhelm you with bells and whistles. If you are managing a major project, then you just dig a little deeper to find a full-featured project manager. I have implemented this software with companies and non-profit organizations of various sizes, and have always had excellent user adoption because of the way they have layered in the complexity. Project members with just a few tasks can focus on their short lists, while their project managers still have a view of the project as a whole. Through their integration with InstaGantt, you can even generate the Gantt chart schedules that everyone expects from a project schedule. They integrate with Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box, making for a truly unique experience in file-sharing, because of the way that users can attach a file from their cloud storage. Through the MS Office integration with Dropbox and Box, co-workers can open a file in Asana, edit it in the same window, and save it, so that anyone looking in Asana or the cloud system will see the latest version. With Box, you can even attach a folder if you want to share a collection of files. Recently, they also introduced custom fields, so if the basic task does not track everything you need, you can easily add it (for a price). Their pricing structure continues to evolve in a way that makes this Freemium software increasingly expensive if you want to use it with multiple teams or organizations. They calculate per-user pricing based on the number of users in the group, so if you belong to more than one, they get to double-dip by charging you for each group. They are also cutting back on the functionality for the free version, having removed advanced reporting and basic admin functions for new groups.",15/12/2016,"Pros: - easy to use for checklists and projects of all sizes - phenomenal user guide, with lots of pictures and videos non-tech savvy users will appreciate - integration with cloud storage for easy document management - try it for your children's chores","Cons: - pricing is climbing quickly, especially for new and multi-team users - no built-in Gantt charts - takes some time to understand who will receive notifications of various activities - would be nice to be able to enter more info about sub-tasks without having to open each pane"
102,102 Asana,Asana,Isaac N.,Founder & Owner,Internet,2+ years,4,4,4,5,4,8,“One of the best Project Management Software”,"Overall: I am using asana everyday creating tasks, managing projects in a very easy way",6/5/2020,"Pros: I liked the simplicity of the usage, adding a task and applying it to a user is very easy also other feature the software has",Cons: I would improve the way of managing the workspaces so it will be easyer to find and remember in what worspace i have added a task. Another thing to improve is the way to find any project as the projects are showing on a left column without a way to search and find the needed project and lot of times when you have a large list it becomes very anoing
103,103 Asana,Asana,Matheus R.,CTO,Education Management,2+ years,5,5,5,,4,10,"“Great tool, a little on the expensive side”","Overall: We are using Asana to track our growth experiments, our sprints, and every task.",26/11/2019,"Pros: This is simply the best Task tool. We have tried many others. However, the UX, subtasks, task report and all the other features are the best in the market.","Cons: The pricing is really hard, charging 14 USD for each team member is much more than it had to be, we are thinking about moving from Asana just because our team is growing."
104,104 Asana,Asana,Hany A.,Product Manager,Computer Hardware,2+ years,5,3,4,,,8,“A Great Collaboration tool between teams”,,14/10/2019,,"Cons: not very user friendly to get used to at first, and very confusing in selecting the best way to organise and collaborate;"
105,105 Asana,Asana,Sara B.,Fondatrice,Public Relations and Communications,2+ years,5,4,3,,,8,“Happy with Asana”,,12/10/2019,,"Cons: It doesn't have a desktop app and this is really, really, really annoying... Also, I wish I could track my time in the free version."
106,106 Asana,Asana,Leah J.,Senior Data Analyst,Internet,2+ years,4,3,5,4,4,9,“Excellent project management tool for small to mid-size teams”,"Overall: I have used Asana in two separate small companies (advertising agency, startup) and have been happy with its application both times. It elucidates people's workload and progress, and - ideally - helps prevent employee overload. In both instances, I've found that a reliable, consistent application of standard use is absolutely necessary for it to be an effective project management tool (especially absent a designated full-time project manager).",3/12/2018,"Pros: Asana is highly customizable, which makes it an excellent project management tool for software, website, app, business dev, and creative applications (marketing, copywriting, graphic design, etc). It regularly deploys new, usable features (like kanban boards and gant charts) to track project progress and timeliness. The built-in organization system for creating a taxonomy of projects and sub-projects is useful. Tagging allows high visibility into each user's productivity and process, and helps keep everyone on task. Asana is definitely best for small-mid size teams (say, <50 people at most), or within departments.","Cons: There's a definite learning curve: layouts can be counterintuitive, and the icon system (instead of using text to identify actions within the user-interface) takes time to learn. Additionally, (like any project management platform), an organization-wide process/policy for using Asana is necessary for it to be effective. It's also important - of course - to ensure everyone consistently uses Asana for tracking, so that project information and progress is aggregated in one place."
107,107 Asana,Asana,Winston M.,Software Developer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,9,“Organizing and controlling our professional and personal activities is a reality with Asana.”,"Overall: Asana has given me many satisfactions in regards to the administration of jobs and routines that are carried out in the company, among these benefits that this system offers us is that our projects never stop, since the members of our team will always be fulfilling their roles, because they can work in their homes and even from where they are. Another success of this platform is through the task management software we can perform individual tasks without the need to have them associated with a common project, it is also very functional.",24/7/2019,"Pros: Asana is an excellent platform for managing tasks and projects whose functions have allowed me to solve everything related to organization, planning and control of the processes carried out by our work groups and the roles that each one must fulfill, so that my projects are an reality. This system allows me to customize tasks and projects, if i want the tasks to be repeated i can create a checklist, where i can copy and paste each time i use them, with this function i save a lot of time by having everything structured in the form of templates. Another very important aspect i like is that with Asana i can reduce amounts of emails and meetings that used to be done with members or members of a team to evaluate their activities, in this way we can track the progress of the tasks.","Cons: Asana has a detail that does not allow us to change our projects once they have started, it also has a excesive amount of options which can be a bit confuse, thats make the learning curve a bit steep."
108,108 Asana,Asana,Laura K.,President,Events Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“We live and breathe Asana”,"Overall: Asana is the perfect tool for capturing not only day to day tasks, but processes that must be repeated over and over. In addition to managing our projects, we use it for onboarding new staff any anything else that requires consistent action items. For the manager, it is a great tool to see what staff is working on and who is falling behind.",20/7/2020,"Pros: Asana has become the heartbeat that makes our company work. As event managers, our livelihood is our ability to follow through on a zillion tasks every day. Asana make that possible for us. We created a master template for our events that make setting up a new one a breeze and allows us to constantly improve our process. We love that we can invite clients into the system at no additional charge; and limit what the see. For non-techies, it looks like a check-list, so the learning curve is really quick (and we love the specials when you finish a task - add new ones please","Cons: There is still work to be done on templates. If you add deadlines so you can copy with dates, the template shows up on your to do list. If you check off, you lose the items. You also can't assign a task to multiple people, so if for example you want to add a ""do your timesheet"" task for you staff, you need do it for every single person."
109,109 Asana,Asana,Geovanna V.,Designer,Design,2+ years,5,4,4,4,5,10,“The best for project & team coordination”,"Overall: All my projects are organized and I'm able to keep a track of them, also, in Asana you can assign tasks and select a date for follow ups, I use the comments all the time and since we can assign team members, it's great for internal communication.",2/4/2020,"Pros: How easy is to organize the tabs, assign new projects, team members, select date for project follow up, there is also an option to add comments on every project (my favorite feature) this has helped my team to have a better track and communication on every project","Cons: At first is a little bit tricky to understand how it works, I feel like there should be a section where they can show all the great features that they have, since there are so many."
110,110 Asana,Asana,Mia B.,Owner,Online Media,2+ years,5,4,5,,,10,“Asana is a pretty big deal”,,28/2/2019,,"Cons: I don't like that the calendar view of cycled tasks won't show future scheduled tasks until I complete the current week's task. So, once I check a task as complete, it will then populate at the next scheduled time. Before that, it won't show up at all in the future. This keeps me from being able to look at next month's (or even next week's) tasks to see what my schedule will hold. Seems like an unnecessary limitation."
111,111 Asana,Asana,Mark F.,Administrator,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“The Free Version Fits Us Great”,"Overall: I'm the administrator of my church and thus have people that I need to share to-do lists with to see things get done. I'm paid staff but work with volunteers, so software is the best way to stay in contact with each other. Asana has helped me keep projects organized so everyone can see what everyone else is doing, has done, and has yet to do.",29/11/2018,"Pros: I love the recurring task feature! I have weekly duties that I need to accomplish every week, so having to put those in every single week would be very tedious! But with Asana, I just set the task to recurring, select the frequency of it, and I'm done! I also enjoy the project folders that are shareable if I choose. I have a specific project folder that's only my recurring list, one for actionable items that come up in staff meetings, one for miscellaneous tasks, and 2-5 others, depending on the open projects we're working on.","Cons: It's a small annoyance more than a con of the software, but I've had a team member tell me that he will sometimes receive his email notifying him of a task I've assigned to him many hours after I actually assigned it to him. I'm not sure if that was Asana's fault, or the fault of his email provider, but it's annoying when that happens. In another task manager app I used for a while, there was an option with a slider to gauge the progress of a task by percentage. So if I was half done with something, I could move the slider to 50% completed. I'm bummed that Asana doesn't have something similar."
112,112 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Accounting,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Asana Review”,"Overall: Love it. We are an accounting firm, so probably not the typical client (I'm guessing it's more suited for marketing or tech companies) but we've made it work because it's so customizable. Super easy to use & love the extra delight feature (sometimes it's the little things, right?).",1/10/2018,"Pros: Our firm implemented Asana, after remarkably not having a system in place for task management. Going from nothing to something was a huge improvement, which allowed us to streamline communication, task management, and visibility among teams. We created hundreds of projects for each of clients, and then set recurring tasks within each project. Implementation was pretty much a breeze, as we had a really great Asana team member helping with every step in the process. Asana also has the best help center of any other platform I've worked with, and I use many systems! It's a really great tool for task management, and we've had success rolling it out with our team members.","Cons: Would have loved to have seen a better Slack / Asana integration but it wasn't a deal breaker by any means. We have hundreds of Asana projects, and hundreds of Slack channels, so the integration was basically not possible. Minor con, though - as the perks outline the cons. Also find the notifications to be a bit lacking in that I either get notifications on the hundreds of projects I'm involved in (I'm in an account management role) or I get no notifications. The notifications are much managable for teams that are more specialized, and only have access to a subset of our projects, vs. someone like me, who is on every project."
113,113 Asana,Asana,Dave V.,Founder and Arts Chaplain,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,4,3,5,4,5,7,“A very capable team task manager. Maybe too capable. ”,"Overall: I've used Asana to manage a small non-profit Art Space. We used it to plan and complete renovations and various art shows. We used the free tier, so we didn't have access to creating our own reusable project templates, which was frustrating and work-making. But it did keep us on track and help us get things done when they needed to get done. That said, even with the occasional flying unicorn, I wouldn't say Asana is a joy to use. Work still very much feels 'worky'. For the person who loves organizing their task list with minute detail - Asana is gold. For the person looking for a lightweight project manager that gets out of the way, keep looking. Something like Trello may be better for you.",6/9/2018,"Pros: I cannot imagine wanting to do anything with my task list that this tool cannot do. There are some bells and whistles behind the paywall I'd like access to, but really even the free version is super packed with features. Tasks can depend on each other and even exist in multiple projects! I love how conversations happen inline - right in the context of the work being done - rather than the sloppy mess of random thoughts and scrolling that Slack can become.","Cons: Asana's weakness is the flip side of its strength - power and complexity. This is not a lightweight tool. In the early days, I tried it and felt overwhelmed immediately then gave up. After a major redesign a few years ago (and a great mobile app), Asana has become MUCH more accessible. However, after a year or more of use, I find myself becoming overwhelmed again. I think this is because Asana's perspective is on individual tasks within a project FIRST. So I log in and see a hundred things that I eventually have to do and that is overwhelming."
114,114 Asana,Asana,David V.,Content Director,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Over 2 Years of Using Asana - And Counting”,"Overall: To be completely honest, I can't extol the virtues of Asana enough. Asana has immeasureably improved so many facets of our organization. Chief among them: productivity, accountability, interdepartmental coordination, and communication. If you're going from no project management software to Asana, you are going to be absolutely delighted. I've recommended it to several colleagues in other organizations who had no project management tool, and they have all started using it and love it. I've also used other project management software in the past (Wrike, Teamwork, and a few others), and none of it compares to what Asana has to offer. There are a few kinks here and there that I've experienced over the years, but Asana's help section is loaded with helpful tutorials and information. And every time I have emailed Asana for help, I have gotten a prompt and thorough response.",4/11/2016,Pros: I like just about every facet of Asana,"Cons: The reporting functions could be more robust. The advanced search is amazing - if those searches could be exported as a CSV or converted into a report of some kind, that would be outstanding. There are tools that will do Asana reports, like Weekdone, but they're a little annoying. It would be much more convenient to have it within the platform itself. Time tracking within the platform could also be good. Harvest in particular is a truly awful time tracker. We use Toggl's integration (an extension in Chrome), but even that's not ideal since it's hard to determine how much time has been spent on any 1 task (or task and subtasks)."
115,115 Asana,Asana,Sama A.,"Director, Product Development",Airlines/Aviation,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,"“Easy to use, multipurpose”","Overall: It's useful for our audit purposes to track; good for agile. Multi-purpose too can be used for sales, operations, admin and project boards.",24/6/2020,"Pros: We use it for our agile product log, great and easily customized. The free feature is unlike most other software, very comprehensive and includes key features. I plan to upgrade as soon as our team grows. You can manage multiple boards at once.","Cons: The feature to track per user the tasks closed and speed is not as good as jira, would be good to have a plugin for agile specifically for sizing cards."
116,116 Asana,Asana,Brian D.,Managing Principal,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“Asana is amazing”,Overall: My overall experience is great. Asana has made many improvements that I think were necessary over the last 2 years. Now it's a great PM system and it's allowed me an my team to work remotely with great oversight.,19/6/2020,"Pros: What is impressive about Asana is it's versatility. It's simple and easy to use but as you learn more it has a lot of horsepower. It's great that there are monthly updates to the software, great learning modules in the Asana Academy and I'm super excited about the Future of Asana meeting next month.","Cons: I don't like that the reports are very limited. Seems like you need to use the API to really get the most out of it. Also the integration with Gmail only works ok, they could polish it better."

Frustrated with new changes. ”,"Overall: The software is good, but so feature-heavy, that if you don't roll it out and coach your teams on how it should be used - everyone will use it in different ways and communication will breakdown. If you are a leader of a team, esp in a high growth dynamic startup, be wary",16/4/2020,Pros: It's a powerful and flexible tool for managing complex projects across teams.,"Cons: Their support team is slow to respond and typically does not even help you what you need. Pricing is also ridiculous that you have to pay for accounts you don't use. They force you to purchase in packs of 5 people. You have a team of 11 - you have to pay for 4 seats you don't use. To save you the 3-4 day response time it takes to get a support ticket reply, I'll tell you now they will say there is no way for them to do this. I will likely churn from this software at the first chance I get. Why say the price per user when you cant scale your userbase PER USER... no one hires and fires in groups of 5, so why do you price this way?"
119,119 Asana,Asana,Tracey M.,Marketing Director,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Best Project Management Tool”,"Overall: Asana has dramatically improved our team communications. We can actually chat on a project via Asana versus using long email threads. There is also a Gmail integration which you can use to set up tasks on projects via emails that you receive. Each project also gives you multiple options such as adding files, images, etc. to keep all your important components in one place, versus scattered about multiple file drives.",30/9/2019,"Pros: Asana gives you the capability to manage multiple projects across multiple work spaces. It is very easy to navigate and simple to categorize your items according to your teams need. They even provide a very helpful on-boarding tool to use for your team integration. There is also the option to set up your own project templates to provide ease of establishing new projects on your team work space. I also enjoy the background options, I have my own set up to display snow falling, and it makes my work that much more enjoyable","Cons: There is a bit of a learning curve, especially if you have employee's that are not very technically savvy. The Asana integration template is most helpful with this ""con""."
120,120 Asana,Asana,Dara S.,Financial Administrator,Architecture & Planning,2+ years,5,5,3,,,7,“Works great if you stick to it”,"Overall: We've tried various Project Management software and I like Asana cause its not trying to be everything in one. Other programs want to manage the money side of things as well (costs, contracts, etc.), where as Asana is just managing the task list. Its simple, its quick, and it helps our team run seamlessly from one aspect of a project to another.",20/8/2019,"Pros: My boss loves checklists. He even gave us all a copy of the Checklist Manifesto by Atul Gawande. Asana is like the checklist manifesto of our office. It took some time to implement, and set up. It took even more time getting people used to using it and making sure they use it often. Now that we do, its amazing. We've set up templates and as soon as we set up a project we can assign tasks. Each team member knows when they complete a task to check it off and assign the next (either to themselves or someone else). It keeps everyone moving and on schedule.","Cons: It takes everyone working it to make it work. If someone forgets to check something off as complete, or forgets to assign the next task to someone, it just falls through the cracks. And there's nothing to alert you to something getting dropped. It also doesn't have a way (that I know of) to see a bird's eye view of everything. When you look at a project, that's all you see, where every once in a while I would like to see them all at once and scroll through them to see if anything is getting dropped."
121,121 Asana,Asana,Neyda Jose M.,Software Developer,Computer Software,2+ years,4,3,4,4,3,9,“Good solution to accelerate the workflow”,"Overall: At first it was not simple to adapt to this tool but due to the high interactivity that is had when assigning tasks, establishing deadlines and conversing and exchanging files with the users who have been assigned for the elaboration of tasks is simple and comfortable use the tool because its use has become an advantage, since with it you can track the status of each task or project to know how advanced it is or if changes have been made, also the workflow is really accelerated.",17/5/2019,"Pros: Asana is a software that I like for different reasons one of them is that it is a tool that not only works to accelerate the workflow but also allows team collaboration and this is because as users we can choose who to invite, what task assign, what deadline that person has for delivery and even interact with them by means of comments that help with their doubts, besides it is not necessary for the user to be in a predefined place since this software is available for mobile devices and is as well as it can be accessed from any place to continue advancing projects or assignments and the best thing is that every change that is necessary to communicate to those who are participating in this project can be done through email or internal channels and there is no limit with respect to the tasks that must be performed and this makes it suitable to carry out the development of any type of company.","Cons: Asana, despite being really useful and efficient to carry out task management is not perfect because it is a tool that has a really high learning curve so to understand each function it is necessary to take time to navigate its interface and gradually getting to know the options it offers and thus find the workflow that best suits the needs of the user."
122,122 Asana,Asana,Alex T.,Front End Developer,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“The perfect solution for project management scalability”,Overall:,16/5/2019,Pros: Asana's flexible board layout allowed my project management team to create an incredible workflow process that gives us a precise answer to where the project progress is at. This layout paired with their notification system provides the perfect solution to giving clients critical updates regarding their projects which plays a massive role in maintaining our customer relationships.,Cons: One feature that my team and I wish this software had was a project template feature where you could create a new project and set a default template with our entire workflow laid out for us. There is a current workaround where you can duplicate existing projects but having this feature would certainly make the process more efficient.
123,123 Asana,Asana,Eman J.,Recruiting Coordinator,Outsourcing/Offshoring,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,9,“Asana is one of the best project management software out there!”,Overall:,28/12/2018,"Pros: With Asana, it is easy now to keep track with all of your project responsibilities and client commitments without leaving cracks a long the way. You don't need to be tech savvy as well in order for you to learn the tricks and benefits it offers, because you can learn it as you experiment each day. Before I was using post-its, and if it is not that sticky much, it can fly - fly with the responsibility you have committed to do within the day or two, and you can't use that as an excuse when your boss or your senior asks you why you haven't done that. This problem has been resolved by Asana because it integrates all of your notes or to-dos from your email, spreadsheet, the every famous post-its, google keeps and everything you need to do to manage your projects. We in the recruitment handles a lot of recruitment projects or positions each time and without Asana you'll loose track, and it will be hard to bounce back",Cons: What I least like about Asana is that you cannot learn all of its functionality just in a single day. I hope they send an email with each subject or functionality with a video link so that it will be easy for someone to learn all of the things you need to learn to enjoy Asana's services in a day.
124,124 Asana,Asana,Audrey R.,"Manager of Design, Teaching and Learning with Technology",Higher Education,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,"“Flexible, full-featured Project Management tool”","Overall: As a team, we are much better using this tool than using a ticket-tracking program like Jira. The UI is cleaner and simpler and does pretty much everything we need it to do.",11/10/2018,"Pros: My team uses Asana for project task tracking and assigning. Sometimes it's a place to capture ideas, formal tasks, meeting notes, have a roadmap with connected projects... we even have a page for on-boarding. It is super easy to get started, but has so many great features that take time to learn the ins and outs of how to use best. I love the nested tasks and ability to create sections. I like being able to assign a lead to any given task, which helps to provide ownership and accountability. The timeline view is also handy when trying to show the long game to a stakeholder. Being able to add files is also handy in having a single place to put something that might be related. All of it culminates in being a project management tool that can be as flexible as you want, as rigid or as informal, while allowing for communication on a task, project, or a general status level. There's also Slack integration, which makes it even easier to remember all the things when using two tools. I'm sure there are still tons of things I can learn and optimize and, honestly, I'm excited to do so","Cons: Occasionally I do want to assign two people to a task, so that there is backup when someone is away."
125,125 Asana,Asana,Gabriel M.,Junior Graphic Designer,Religious Institutions,2+ years,4,5,4,4,5,8,“Great Organization & Workflow Visual!”,,5/7/2018,,"Cons: What I would like to see improved is some guidelines or some idea of the way the platform is meant to be used. My team has figured out what best works for us, but that really took us playing around with it and organizing ourselves. I wonder what the developers actually had in mind and if we are really using it up to it's greatest potential. I'm also not a fan of the ""List"" style layout of reports and find it quite confusing. Also I'm not sure what the purpose of the Dashboard section is or quite how to use it. Again, guidelines/tutorials for each new user that is added on would be quite helpful."
126,126 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Higher Education,2+ years,4,5,4,2,,,"“Easy, even fun project management - for a price”",,8/5/2018,,"Cons: We needed to to associate documentation, notes, and chats with projects as a whole (not just embed them within tasks), and the free version of Asana didn't allow this. We found that the paid version was *very* expensive, and there was no discount for academic institutions. Also, their customer service reps frequently got in touch with random members of the team to try to convince us to switch to the paid plan. They were really pushy, and they didn't add any value (ex. providing a compelling argument or offering applicable expertise) with their calls. Finally, the interface design is optimized to feel fun and friendly - large, slightly goofy typography, bright pinks and colors, etc. We ultimately (for many reasons) switched to Active Collab, and the whole team feels like the design is more efficient and professional than Asana's."
127,127 Asana,Asana,Chris G.,Department Manager,Civil Engineering,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana- A Game Changer for this Small Company”,"Overall: Prior to finding Asana we did what most small companies do...Struggled with spreadsheets and dry erase boards for scheduling and project monitoring. We were constantly looking for an alternative to this process but the fee's were excessive, the software was far more complex than we required, and certain functions were limited (I.E. Mobile applications). While Asana is not a full blown project management solution.....For those of us that don't need that complexity or advanced reporting, Asana is the bomb. Our setup runs four office staff members and four mobile field crews and I oversee approximately 175+ different projects. The field crews have been provided cellular tablets and operate the mobile version of Asana, while the office staff operate the full version of Asana on computers. Every day we assign the various staff members or crews their tasks and we monitor them from the office (This is great when a customer wants to know when their work is done and we can tell them almost real time). We have then added the custom fields to include staff members included in the work, hours worked, vehicles driven, and mileage.....So we are now locking in a big picture view of what is happening on our projects. We have also integrated the reports in a way so that we can use the Asana reports to create time sheets and billing reports. We also use the attachments function to pass pictures and data files between the office and field almost seamlessly (prior to this it was gmail and files could take forever to transfer...Asana almost does it instantly).",3/11/2016,"Pros: Ease of use, Price, Functionality",Cons: Limit of projects for team calendar. There are work around but it does become cumbersome.
128,128 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,3,4,,5,7,"“Great value, but methodology conflicts.”","Overall: We really enjoyed it, but Basecamp's methodology just fit OUR business best. I'd imagine we are in the minority here, but that's just my opinion. Both are great, affordable options for new business owners, and established ones as well.",14/9/2020,Pros: This is great for teams who want more detail than Trello with more intuitive task/project templates. It has a very robust free option and a reasonable upgrade pricing than can scale with each business. You can use traditional project task lists and Gantt/Agile boards in conjunction. This makes it more robust than Trello.,"Cons: I don't typically say this as an ""early adopter"", but there were actually too many features. We got lost in all of what the product offered and ended up going with Basecamp which has a much more easy to digest onboarding process. Perhaps that is a personal anecdote and not the ""norm"", but that was our experience."
129,129 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“Asana: Project Management Simplified”,Overall: Works great and most definitely makes tracking and accomplishing tasks much easier then something like excel.,29/8/2020,Pros: Asana is a great entry into tracking projects. Even with the free version your able to track tasks and assign them to individual users. It's also possible to view all the tasks in both a list or a board view for easy visualization of outstanding tasks.,Cons: There is a pretty big paywall between the free and paid version of Asana. A lot of the great features of Asana do require a paid subscription and in my opinion its a little pricey.
130,130 Asana,Asana,Becky M.,Virtual Assistant,Consumer Services,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,10,“Must have tool for small businesses!”,"Overall: Asana has really simplified my project management processes. I can quickly check on my tasks for the week, team member's tasks, stay on top of deadlines, and view all the information I need in a single location. It's a huge time saver for me since I don't have to hunt all over the internet for files, photos, communication, etc.",19/6/2020,"Pros: Asana's projects help keep my teams organized and stop things from falling through the cracks. I love the ease of creating tasks, sharing files, and communicating in a logical way. Integration was my business was extremely easy and felt very natural.","Cons: Asana doesn't offer as many features and integrations as some of the competitors. However, this can be a good thing when I'm working with clients and teams who aren't very tech-savvy. They can pick up Asana more quickly because there's less to learn and less to confuse them. The simplicity of Asana is what makes it a really great system."
131,131 Asana,Asana,Michael D.,VP of Operations,Wholesale,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Easy to Use Task Management Sofware.”,"Overall: Asana has made it easy to divy up tasks, make sure that we stay on target, and stay out of our email boxes. Having all of our project related info in one place is so much easier than looking through multiple threads of emails. Images, pdfs, and other files attach easily. Their mobile app is also easy to navigate and allows me to respond while not at my desk.",29/4/2020,"Pros: Honestly, my favorite feature is the fact that everything we put in here can be searched for. We have been using Asana for maybe the past 4 years and all of the projects/tasks that we have worked on can all be found in one place. This is great for when we have new people that need to get caught up to speed.",Cons: I know there are more features that we haven't used because we have been using the free version so I cant really speak to this.

I cannot say enough good things about Asana.,8/1/2020,"Pros: In a previous role I was on a very busy marketing team that rarely had visibility on what the other was doing, BEFORE Asana. I was a champion of Asana and a quick-learner. I had to manage upwards of 75-100 events in a 4 month period that all needed marketing materials and had different dates and details. I couldn't have done it without Asana. There was no way to track it before Asana. Our team was sending emails constantly. Asana saved my work brain","Cons: I worked with people who did not love Asana and honestly that was the hardest part. Because I loved it and they didn't, we used the tool very differently which made it harder. I think your team has to be 100% all in to use it well."
133,133 Asana,Asana,Sarah P.,CEO,Online Media,2+ years,5,5,5,,3,10,“Great for Organization and Creating Workflows”,"Overall: At first, there was a learning curve with Asana, but once I began to understand it I fell in love. I am able to create workflows, organize client information, create todo lists, and more. Best of all now you can switch between lists, boards, calendars and more after creating 1 board. It is the bet feature overall. My only disappointment lies in the pro version. There are several features I would love to have access too, but it does not make sense for me to upgrade when I would have to buy 5 seats when I only need 1 for me.",7/12/2019,"Pros: I love how easy it is to be able to do a variety of types of boards in a workspace. You can create lists, calendars, boards, ect...and now you have the ability to transition your board between the different formats. My absolute favorite aspect of Asana is how the Due Dates you assign to users will show up on a calendar, helping you keep a close eye on your due dates to complete a project or stay on track for client work.","Cons: My least favorite aspect is the paid versions are not practical for a solopreneur. I love Asana, and try to use it for everything business...there are several features of the pro version I would love to use, but it is not rational for me to purchase 5 seats when I need 1. Another issue I have is the amount of RAM this web-based program uses when running. I have burned up 2 hard drives trying to keep it open while working throughout the day. I love the ease of the software but it's heavy-duty."
134,134 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Environmental Services,2+ years,5,4,4,4,5,10,"“Free User, Love Asana”",Overall: Task management and light project management great tool,29/11/2019,"Pros: Free! One of the best task management software around, excellent tool for light project management. Features include color tagging, multiple projects (no limit), invite multiple people (team members), a great feature that you can invite certain people to certain teams or projects. Tasks can repeat (one of the reasons we selected Asana over other tools) Very fun feature is called celebrations, when you click off a couple of tasks that are completed you get fun vibrant characters fly across your screen.",Cons: I can not complain about a free tool like this. Which it was more affordable to upgrade. Which more companies had subscriptions based on tiers instead of how many users you have. Sometimes subtasks repeat themselves even though they are completed. Wish the repeat function had like 3rd Thursday of the month for dates
135,135 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Health,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“The perfect task list for projects”,"Overall: I used Asana as a project manager and loved it. I used it as Director of Marketing to organize our Grand Opening strategy and loved it! My only problem was that I couldn't get my entire leadership team to buy-into working on it ... which defeated the purpose a lot. I still use it on a personal level, and once I get my own team I'll be implementing it for sure.",13/11/2019,"Pros: Collaborating with team is easy - the different views of projects also really helped! You can view the project by date almost like a grant chart, or you can view it organized by phases, or you could have it as a workflow where tasks get moved based on their status. I loved that it was easy to customize the fields - adding and removing task fields. Additionally, having a section with a personal task list where you can mark things off was so helpful! It organized it by the due date and the small animations on the screen when you completed a task were a nice touch.","Cons: Nothing really. I was very pleased with all the features and how they all worked. If anything, sometimes the grant chart view with dates was a bit hard to read - however, aren't all grant charts a bit wonky and long sometimes?"

Many users will be able to get by with the free version for a long time.,30/9/2019,"Pros: Recurring tasks really sealed the deal for me, but it's also got a great calendar view and plenty of features to keep my various projects organized and on schedule",Cons: A little hard to follow a tasks history as it recurs since comments get dropped with each recurrence. I hacked it by putting comments in the task description so they persist.
137,137 Asana,Asana,Ryan H.,Senior SEO Strategist,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,5,4,4,9,“Asana Review”,,2/8/2019,,"Cons: It can be cluttered at times and while it is dynamic, it can be overwhelming if you don't know how to use it. Once you get accustomed to the platform and understand how it works, it is easy to structure and build your taskboards. However, for beginners, that process can seem chaotic at first."
138,138 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Financial Services,2+ years,4,5,4,3,4,7,“The best designed task management tool for my small startup team”,,4/2/2019,,"Cons: Asana is a small, growing team that has been making some fast developments which I love; but that also means there is a lot of room for improvement. Their calendar is far from perfect, and calendar is a critical part of task management. You cannot drag dates to set an event, not to mention selecting multiple dates (duration) for a single event. You cannot color code them or add a reminder. Integration with other apps would have also been incredibly helpful. If their calendar isn't perfect, they could've allowed integration with other apps such as Google Calendar, iCal, Eventbrite, Gmail, etc. a lot of tools used by teams. Integration with Slack could've made Asana my favorite tool ever. Another thing I dislike is the inability to assign tasks to multiple people. I understand their theory on having ownership for a task, but teams, especially small startups, often share tasks."
139,139 Asana,Asana,Chad W.,Front-End Developer,Internet,2+ years,5,5,4,,4,9,“Full featured task management for small teams”,"Overall: I use Asana every day with my coworkers and project manager for website development and maintenance. we've tried several other task management systems, and even went to the more full-featured Podio for a few months. We ended up returning to Asana because of its flexibility, ease of use, and deep feature-set.",21/10/2018,"Pros: Asana is a fast and easy-to-use task management system that's great for Agile development and small team project management. It has Integrations with time tracking software and the app is rock solid. One of my favorite features compared to other task management software is infinite child tasks. Any task in any project can have an infinite number of subtasks, each with their own dependencies, assignments, and due dates. This allows you to take big and complex projects and turn them into bite-sized check boxes, which is a exactly what a task management system is supposed to do. They also handle attachments really well.","Cons: I'm still a little salty that there's no native desktop app for Mac or PC, but there are ways around it. Another small con is that after you create a project, it's stuck in that layout forever. If you use the trello-style board when you create the project, you can't switch back to the normal layout. I would also like smarter sorting options when viewing ""my tasks"". Currently their start and end dates feature is kind of at odds with the sort-by-date feature."
140,140 Asana,Asana,M. D.,accounting supervisor,51-200 employees,2+ years,4,3,4,,,7,“Home Management / Project Management Software”,"Overall: I am using this software for home project management. I set up ""Projects"". I have it set up so that there are a list of daily routines that repeat each day with an updated ""due date"". She can check off as she does them. This gives a sense of accomplishment and helps establish habits.Then I set up additional larger projects that have tasks to be completed on certain days. I have a bedroom remodel project. a declutter project. An ""appointments"" project. The tasks to complete these projects get assigned due dates or action dates, based on where I can see opportunity to get them handled. Some of the ""projects"" are actually goals that I have to get our house in order. Setting each of them up as Projects helps me to see that we are making progress a little at a time. This helps me to stay positive about the fact that I have so many things that I want to complete. I use this at work as well in much the same way. But currently I am the only team member working on my work projects. I have so many things going on that I needed some way to categorize and manage the overwhelming amount of half done work items that I don't want to forget about (or miss a deadline on)",18/10/2018,"Pros: Free version is a decent product. You can set up multiple ""Projects"". Under each project you can assign smaller ""tasks"" that are basically all the steps necessary to complete the larger ""project"". You can invite family members to the Projects so that they are able to view the big picture. You can assign individual ""tasks"" to specific family members. It is helpful for everyone to see how their assigned task fits into the big picture. It is also helpful for inexperienced workers to see how many steps are actually involved in bringing a project to completion.","Cons: When you get into using the free version, you realize that some small limitations are annoying. This leads you to accept the 30 day trial of the full version. Even so, I am having some trouble getting the specific ""view"" of remaining tasks that I would like to see. As the creator of the project, and the manager of the team, I would like to have the ability to view a list of each member, with all of their assigned tasks under their name. Currently on the mobile app all that I can see are a list of my own tasks."

It does the trick for an e-commerce marketing team's needs.,14/10/2020,Pros: Asana makes it easy for our team to manage our projects across team members. Our favorite feature is the ability to set reminders for ourselves - it keeps us on task and reminds us of the nitty gritty details that otherwise tend to fall through the cracks.,"Cons: Asana is great for project management, but we weren't huge fans of its calendar views - for our ""visual"" team members, the calendar view interface seemed somewhat clunky."
142,142 Asana,Asana,Santosh S.,Managing Director,Pharmaceuticals,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“Manage your project at ease with Asana”,"Overall: With Asana, assigning tasks, project workflows, duplicating project modules is much efficient, each team members can be assigned with different tasks, so overall project can be organized uniformly. Since, Asana is pretty straight forward to use and doesn't require any training, anyone can have it on their desk and can manage the project accordingly. Asana is customizable, and replaces the daily burden of keeping records in handwritten ledgers, hence making your project streamlined. Highly recommendable",26/8/2020,"Pros: Asana is all in one project management software, keeps track of every users, straightforward to use, intuitive design, and overall monitoring of assigned task is easier with Asana. Asana is an exceptionally well suited application which lets users to do their tasks from a single place with simply a drag and drop. Keeping the project upright with bar graphs, Gantt charts and pie charts is much easier with Asana; also the timeline feature shows the ongoing project, keeping the record with a linear graph, hence comprising of visual tweaks, and tracking the multiple pieces of project across complex team structures.","Cons: To be honest, the pricing is too high for the software, and the simple features such as illustrations with Gantt charts, timeline view are only available in paid version, so there's no way to stick with the free plan, more likely the email feature can be little overwhelming if you've a large number of clients working for a project and you'd be annoyed to check the details of your assigned task from large number of notifications."

This is huge for us because we have a lot of information in some of the emails. Because of this ""con"" I just copy and paste the conversation into ""conversations"" for each project.

BaseCamp was there at the beginning. And even GitHub has some interesting looking project management options. I have tried them all - partly because I want to save money - but I keep on going back to Asana... it is the best project/task management app currently available.,17/1/2020,"Pros: Its obvious to use. Very, very obvious. I would so simple, but Asana is not simple.. oh no, it can solve very complex problems. Its just that its EASY and FAST to use. Quick to click around, quick to get going, quick to switch screens. But this does not mean it does not have depth. We use this both as a product roadmap and as a To Do. This above all is its winning 'feature'. Also, good to note that you can invite as many people who are not on your domain to tasks.","Cons: Please, oh, please allow markup to be used in task descriptions. It will not complicate things, you have 100's (nay, 1000's) of users asking for it, its technically. Oh, it is, now, at the peak end of its affordability. We are a 10 man business and Asana is our third most expensive software purchase - we spend more on it than G-Suite. Given that G-Suite is mail, word processor, spreadsheet etc, that is right up there. think its worth the money, but I can understand that a business with a lot of lower cost employees etc. may find this unaffordable."

My first couple weeks I liked Wrike more but once I got 'settled' into Asana, I found that it was a better tool (at least for me and for our team)",10/12/2019,"Pros: The ""bones"" of Asana makes the most sense to my brain of any of the PM tools that I've used. What I like best is that I think it accomplishes the core goal with simplicity + ease. Very easy to be able to keep tasks + projects on target. Easy for both project managers to stay on top of their team as well as for individuals to stay on top of their work flow.","Cons: Honestly there isn't a ton that I don't like about it. There are some features in Trello (like Parent / Child) that I'd like to see in Asana. If you're super technical, then maybe Wrike's design will be more enjoyable for you (or probably Jira)."

Giving Asana a full 5 stars review",7/11/2019,"Pros: As a Project Manager for a huge company like Alorica that caters to employees all around the globe, that is really tough. Well, okay, I only PM for my company site, but hey! Given how huge the company has grown, just imagine how many employees we have in every site. As projects go on and on for our site, and as employees gets hired and hired each day, and as the building expands and expands.. projects just get larger and larger. This is why I am thankful to Asana! Asana has a user-friendly UI and is very easy to use. Asana has helped keep track of the client groups and the teams each groups has on track. Imagine, as a BPO, we do have atleast three (3) clients situated in one site, and every client group are composed of atleast ten (10) teams in one shift, and that's just one shift in a day. Huge right? But with Asana, work balance, team engagement and goal tracking is made easy","Cons: I can set deadlines for each project and highlight the priorities, and all these made available and shared to teams.. because of Asana! Perhaps, no cons at all! It is genuinely helpful to my work as PM."
147,147 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,4,,5,9,“Easy to facilitate project communication across organizations and geographic limitations”,"Overall: As said above, we are able to communicate a number of tasks to other individuals outside of our organization - the built-in notification system allowed us to immediately be aware of any modified, completed, or added tasks. Also, having the ability to nest tasks is really handy. The main comment thread on the project is very nice as well - I can't really say anything bad about Asana - without it, we would not have been able to complete our integration plans.",31/10/2019,"Pros: We just went through a company merger, and many of the integration processes required communication and collaboration between people not only from the other company, but from partners, vendors, and more.","Cons: The card view is pretty limited, but this feature is new. I'd like to see the capability of creating additional swim lanes and color code the cards, etc. Also, I would like to see the ability to assign resources to an 'entitity' which aren't necessarily a project team member. I.e. they would be 'placeholders,' so I can create project templates and not have to have individuals entered into our team/system, since those resources might change depending on the nature of the project."
148,148 Asana,Asana,Nathaly W.,Marketing coordinator,Utilities,2+ years,5,5,5,,,7,“Imaginations the limit”,"Overall: Over all I find that my imagination is my only limit when working with asana. It has so ability ability and capability that most of time I could google how to do XYZ and probably beable to create it into Asana. I find that asana is quickly becoming a go to tool for organising my work life and now I'm looking for how I can streamline my personal life into it too. I still find that google sheets works out a lot better for me just because I can create my own structures, so I haven't 100% moved over for my personal use. It would be create is Asana had less businessy features for personal users. For example I'm starting a habit tracker and although I can see how I could use it in Asana, I still find that sheets is better for me because I can make more thorough reports.",30/9/2019,"Pros: My favourite features in this software is the ability to cross-reference tasks between projects, have the ability to create sub tasks and repeat tasks automatically (if set up). I also love that I can create custom fields suited to my project. Fields are so helpful in getting a quick glance and status check. They also help me with my productivity. Lastly, I love the advanced search abilities. I find that I can makes report like searches and in real time.","Cons: I find that if someone adds me to a project without my prior knowledge I often overlook it entirely because I dont actually pay attention to my inbox. The inbox is a little bit difficult for me to use as well as the my tasks. So i prefer it when people verbally tell me about a project that we are working on and then I can keep tabs on that project or when they verbally hand out a task to me, then I keep track of it in my person projects. I sometimes wish it had better integration with google sheets, because I work in sheets a lot of the time."
149,149 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Apparel & Fashion,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Great Tool”,Overall: Asana allowed me to categorize different projects and assign individuals to complete tasks so that I could easily track progress and follow up with my employees.,10/9/2019,Pros: Asana made it very easy to assign tasks and manage projects. It saved me a lot of headaches compared to other services I used before it.,Cons: It would've been nice to integrate a calendar feature as well.
150,150 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Games,2+ years,4,5,3,,5,7,“Another Task List Manager”,"Overall: I like the fact that, like most software these days, it's available on many different platforms and offers the same experience wherever you are on your phone and/or on your PC, but I cannot recommend it over any other software and feel like, in the end, it's just a personal choice. Nothing really makes Asana ""better"" than any other software I used to manage Tasks Lists.",14/8/2019,"Pros: Easy to use, understand and get your hands on, Asana is very nice solution to task tracking for personal use or among small teams. It features different kind of lists, different options and connections with other web solutions such as Phabricator, Google Drive, RingCentral, etc... The interface is straight forward and easy to understand for anyone who starts on the website. It's pretty intuitive and it's trying to appeal to a lot of people.","Cons: It doesn't revolutionize its category of software/services. It doesn't do anything more/better than any other task list manager I've been using so far, so in the end, it's really a matter of preferences. I did not try all the connection options it offered but I did not see the need for those either. All in all, nothing is bad about Asana, but it's hard to recommend it over another software in the same category."
151,151 Asana,Asana,Gonzalo B.,Web Developer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,3,4,,,8,“Great project management tool once you get familiar with it ”,Overall:,18/7/2019,"Pros: Clean, organized, the GUI is inviting and customizable to fit any of our possible needs. I found Asana easy to use and intuitive (once you get your way around), also they have a plethora of integrations if their features are not enough. Where Asana excels is on their different views over the tasks, other project management tools will only show you the tasks in card over a board. But with Asana you can take a general view of the project over time with the Calendar view. Being able to integrate multiple teams in one place meant for us that almost no internal emails were ever sent again, before we were spending too much time checking whether one of our programmers completed or not a task given, checking overall progress, issues and so on. The Files view is also really helpful, is really time-consuming to dive into your mailbox to find an image file sent three months ago with an unspecific name. My clients use the free version and they love it, I found that the work environment is way more positive and productive because the feeling of someone constantly checking on you is gone.","Cons: The chat notifications are easy to miss, often a colleague would write to me and I would never notice they did unless I checked my email or the task itself; it could be also great if each chat message will be slightly more separated from the one below, long conversations are often difficult to read. Takes a bit to figure it out where is what and how to do this and that,sometimes the projects can get complex and the views start to get cluttered and notifications start pilling up quickly."
152,152 Asana,Asana,Miguel G.,Owner,Graphic Design,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,"“Manage projects, tasks, or anything with absolute ease.”","Overall: I use Asana for basic list-base task tracking. It offers visibility of your projects and tasks in either a list based format, or chart (think Kanban) format. Even the free level offers customizations when setting up projects, although limited. But these limited customizations offer a level of support you cannot find in any other competitive product. Asana is also an amazing product to manage personal tasks.",14/3/2018,"Pros: Asana is another collaborative tool that can easily keep your teams aligned. With a free and a premium account, as well as an enterprise version, Asana provides a rich mix of features... even at the free entry level. Manage unlimited tasks, projects, and conversations. Includes basic dashboard, search and limits you to only 15 team members. The free level is one extremely powerful task list with features often found in premium applications. Move up into the 'Premium' level and it removes team size limits, dashboard limits, and adds advanced search and reporting, custom fields, dependencies, privacy, and much more.","Cons: Reporting is one of those things that often suffer in free applications, and with Asana, there is no exception. The reports in the free account are extremely limited and offer very little value, unless you are using the free Asana subscription for personal task management. For small businesses, the Premium or Enterprise solution is highly recommended."
153,153 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,4,3,3,3,4,10,"“Makes organizing tasks easy, great for teams who need to produce work and good for managers”",Overall: It helps us capture and complete work tasks seamlessly and without missing anything.,13/2/2018,"Pros: Asana is very easy to set up, and implicitly orders tasks into client and project groups. Tasks can be assigned to people in the team, and then each team member can see a list of the tasks they're responsible for. Kanban boards and an overview dashboard are there for a higher level management view. Creating, assigning and ticking off tasks is super simple Mobile apps work well enough Lots of features (if you like lots of features, see my Cons) The free plan offers a great platform",Cons) The free plan offers a great platform
154,154 Asana,Asana,Stephen M.,Chief Client Officer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,“Rinse and repeat”,Overall: I have simply saved a lot of time. I plan so much better now that I use Asana. The team are great. I would recommend any new user to get along to one of their events.,29/6/2020,"Pros: We do many implementations with our clients that are very similar. The ability to create templates, maintain them and use for the next project not only saves time, but it allows us to continuously improve what we do. We use rules a lot, and these simply allow us to ensure the data is correct in projects as tasks move through different states. As a manager, I have greater visibility of the state of all my projects which makes my life much simpler.","Cons: SSO is an enterprise feature if you using Azure AD. Security should not be seen as an expensive add on, it should be a primary feature."

Is someone on the project shirking his or her duties?)
156,156 Asana,Asana,Christina D.,COO,Online Media,2+ years,5,5,4,,5,9,“Works great but could use more functionality/integrations ”,Overall: Asana works great as a task management software and the free trial was nice,11/2/2020,Pros: Asana is very easy to use and setup. The free trial account provided us as a team plenty of time to get it set up and get comfortable using the product prior to purchase.,Cons: It would be nice if it had integrations with QuickBooks Online and have better ways to separate customer projects with better timeline graphs.
157,157 Asana,Asana,Jana C.,Associate Director of Recruitment and Admissions,Education Management,2+ years,4,4,4,,3,7,“Team buy-in necessary”,"Overall: The idea behind our team adopting Asana as a project management tool was to ensure transparency and keep track and identify bottlenecks in projects. Unfortunately building the templates does take a lot of time, so full integration can sometimes be difficult. This requires a lot of front-end work which can hinder the process if you're trying to move very quickly. It's also very easy to lose track of a project once it's completed.",12/8/2019,"Pros: Keeping updated on on-going projects and the ability to visualize marketing items. Being able to add materials from a variety of supported sources such as Google Drive really helped increase usability. This is fantastic when planning events, especially recurring ones since you can duplicate boards once the original template is created.","Cons: Tagging two people on a project became confusing and cumbersome. It wasn't easy to set up a ""backup"" person to keep track of items. Also, even though we using a paid version of the software, new features added are not included, making further integration into everyday use less likely."

159,159 Asana,Asana,Corbin M.,Account Services Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“Asana is a top-notch task and project collaboration tool”,"Overall: At least 3X'd my personal productivity. Increased accountability for me and everyone in the company. Helps us put first things first, maximizing the results of our individual and collective work. Allows us to fast-track tasks that used to have complicated timing with back-and-forth hand-offs. Enables managers to set due dates and times, so there's no question on when something needs to be done. Projects allow for major subdivided categories of our business to be organized and visualized.",12/12/2017,"Pros: Used in the correct way, Asana makes it so that tasks can be prioritized, assigned, followed, collaborated on, completed, recorded, and never forgotten. It has allowed me to perform better at my job. Instead of 1000 sticky notes all over my desk and computer, I have 0 ever since we started using Asana. It allows me to see all my priorities in 1 place so that I can start with the most urgent projects. It helps me perform way better at my job, keeping our clients and my boss happy. I've tried a couple other competing softwares and Asana is the best in my experience.","Cons: There is a slight learning curve to get the hang of all the most basic functionality in Asana. Example: creating sub-tasks within tasks, within projects, assigning tasks, adding task followers, setting due dates and times. I'm sure there are a lot of other cool things I could be doing on Asana, but I just haven't learned them yet."
160,160 Asana,Asana,David S.,Senior Digital Strategist,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,5,4,3,5,8,"“Great and easy, but tweaks would be good”","Overall: Since we've been using Asana we have noticed that we keep better track of all our projects and we avoid things falling between the cracks. Because we have full record of all conversations it also helps settle discussions about responsibilities and has made teams more accountable. It is also much easier to use than other ""similar"" products like Wrike (what a nightmare!) or Jira (not user friendly) so it's always great. Things that could be improved: 1. I would add a second level of ""deadline"": e.g. A final deadline should be provided and a period to complete (with a starting date) should be separate. For example, I would like to know that a task is due by Friday but I want to have it allocated for Wednesday because it will take a couple of days to complete 2. The android app is not great, needs to improve so you can see your tasks ordered by date (you couldn't last time I tried, maybe this is now possible) 3. Time tracking would be a great addition. I know there are plugins, but this should be out of the box 4. Would be good to have some sort of indication of tasks that have subtasks under them without having to click. For example If task 1 has subtasks 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 inside a tree structure on the main screen would work, showing if they are green, red... May not be too useful for people only working on specific tasks, but as an account manager handling 9 projects it helps see how things are going at a glance",3/11/2016,Pros: - Ease of use - Helps productivity - Settles accountability discussions,Cons: - Some items can be improved (see my full review)
161,161 Asana,Asana,Samantha P.,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,4,,5,,,“Exceptional Project Management & Organization Tool (Even the Free Version!)”,"Overall: Last year I was in desperate need of better life organization. I needed a bona fide, comprehensive project management system. I researched many options, hoping to find a platform that had a robust free option (not just another annoying single-feature gateway to get me to chalk up money for the premium version). I read that Asana was widely used and highly recommended. I tried it for myself, and I was not disappointed! First my business partner and I used it to get a better handle on our business operations. Then I also began using it for my daily personal to-do lists as well as other side projects. It's a wonderful thing to consolidate many systems into one, and that's exactly what Asana has provided.",7/6/2016,"Pros: -- Beautiful interface that is intuitive to navigate; the hierarchy is well-organized, allowing you to categorize things into workspaces, projects, tasks, sub-tasks, and so on. -- Easy to add team members and has great functions for collaborating, including being able to assign tasks, comment on your or others' progress, assign due dates, etc. -- Customizable views to help arrange the content exactly how your brain prefers it. -- Can view tasks in either a List View or a Calendar View, both of which are very helpful in different ways. -- Amazing functionality for the free version! The developers don't shortchange you by offering only a few weak features for free. -- In the year+ I've been using Asana, the developers have been steadily improving it. They seem very dedicated to the success of this tool and truly responding to the needs of their users.","Cons: -- I would like to see the notifications aspect of Asana fine-tuned a bit. You can receive notification emails about the tasks assigned to you, but they are limited to three pre-set timeframes. I do use the desktop version of the app and hoped that would help provide pop-up notifications, but I don't believe it does. Ideally for me, the system should be as automated as possible and not require manual checking-in."
162,162 Asana,Asana,Patricia J Z.,Owner,Computer Networking,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Organizational Lifesaver”,Overall: My business would crumble if Asana was not my foundation and support platform storing hundreds of articles and email sequences for me. I have so many projects running in Asana! I would be lost without this tool.,26/8/2020,"Pros: Asana has saved my internet life! The ability to structure my projects into specific areas to keep track of my working progress is priceless. To have a reliable platform to resource all my information saves me hours of work every day. Having a place to store all my work and writings is an author's dream! The software is easily understood and it can be broken into TASKS, separated by PLATFORMS, and specifically broken down in the DETAILS area which makes completing work more manageable. As an author, I want to share more with my readers and Asana provides the structure for me to stay consistent and be targeted in my messages.","Cons: Initial set-up requires great focus. I still find it difficult to move items from one task to another area's task but that is my issue, not the software issue. I tend to be ALL OVER THE PLACE and Asana enables me to see what I have in the works."
163,163 Asana,Asana,Delaney N.,Community Manager,Retail,2+ years,4,4,4,5,5,8,“Great way to keep track of tasks - until they are complete”,Overall: Asana has made work productivity heavily increase because we have an organized timeline to keep track of all the tasks and who is in charge of each.,6/1/2020,"Pros: You can put everything here. All your tasks, projects, campaigns, EVERYTHING and assign them to team members. It is awesome to have all conversations relating to a certain project in one spot so you can easily refer back to feedback and changes/updates for that specific project. You can also go as deep and detailed as you want with each task/project and have subtasks on subtasks.","Cons: The only thing that I would say is a negative is that once a task is marked as complete it is extremely difficult to find and refer back to. Also, when you are assigned a task in a private project you are notified that you are assigned to complete the task but then you can't see the task because it is in a hidden project so that is little annoying."
164,164 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“It's really nice to look at”,"Overall: I think it's awesome. As a user I'm please when working in it, and I don't mind when my boss asks me to keep him updated via asana.",10/12/2019,"Pros: As a front end developer, I cannot say this enough, Asana is beautiful. They seriously inspire me to get better at front end development. Using Asana makes me happy because the design is so intuitive, it has fun micro interactions, and everything makes sense.","Cons: This goes for all project managmeent software, but I will say of every version I've tried Asana does this the best. When there's too much flexibility, too little structure, or little guidance, these tools are nothing more than glorified note pads. However Asana does a great job of offering easy, pain free, and user friendly ways to organize projects. But still, I think there needs to be more structure overall."

It's easy to see and search projects, and notifications are well-implemented",29/10/2019,"Pros: Clean, intuitive, clickable fields everywhere. If a user has restricted access, the access is very clearly delineated which is helpful in not accidentally misclicking if the user is not an administrator. Customizable fields, attractive colors, easy sorting! The forms feature is also wonderful, as it creates a job right away if someone has submitted a form, and recently they made it available to all subscription types.","Cons: The site itself is not responsive to browser width, which in the year 2019 feels odd to me. I have to side-scroll to see all my fields as the project name cell width is permanently too wide for most of my project names. I also cannot have one project's description take up my whole screen with a narrow browser so that I can have it off to the side as I work due to the responsiveness issue--instead I deal with cut-off screens and no collapsing site sizes."
167,167 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Higher Education,2+ years,4,4,3,,,7,“Great for individual and team tasks - UI could use some work”,"Overall: We are using Asana to manage ongoing large projects involving multiple team members, including setting deadlines and sharing document links. It's been a mostly positive experience that has helped us keep tabs on progress and save time.",3/10/2019,"Pros: The task creation process is smooth and mostly intuitive - it's easy to set due dates, assignments, and descriptions. I also like the ability to set permissions on a project basis, so I can keep a private task list as well as contributing to public projects.","Cons: Viewing lists of tasks can be more difficult than it needs to be at times; my biggest frustration is with sub-tasks. There's no easy way to view all the subtasks within a project at a glance - they're only visible when clicking into a parent task. I'd also appreciate the ability to assign a single task to multiple people, instead of duplicating it."
168,168 Asana,Asana,Magali S.,Project Manager,Motion Pictures and Film,2+ years,4,5,5,4,4,9,“Work on important tasks with Asana”,"Overall: We definitely recommend Asana for people, who work in big teams or who are willing to be in time for their products. In addition, this service is very easy to use and understand, so you have all the chances to organize your work at a high level.",6/3/2019,"Pros: There is no doubt that Asana service makes our life easier with no doubts. This tool systemizes and organizes all notes and plans in one list and holds this information in one place. It makes the work process faster and transforms everything into the smoothly running system. Due to this, it is possible to manage weekly or monthly goals without a stop. In addition, Asana's boards are very useful and convenient. With a help of Asana, there is no need to look for all your notes, emails and records to manage your projects. All significant things are kept in one secure place. As a result, you can easily coordinate all important tasks and projects.","Cons: We need to say that Asana has more pluses than minuses. However, there are some drawbacks that should be fixed. Firstly, notifications work with a delay or don't work at all. In order to get them, you need to open Asana constantly in order to stay up to date with your goals. Secondly, Asana's mobile app should be totally improved. It is a little bit buggy and fails to keep pace with desktop software."
169,169 Asana,Asana,Brandon W.,Director of Content Marketing,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,7,“Task Management for Teams”,,22/12/2017,,Cons: The biggest drawback of Asana for me is the inability to edit comments. Users can only delete and type a new one. This seems like a simple thing to add especially when followers and @ mentions get an email notification of every new update to a task.
170,170 Asana,Asana,Brittney C.,Marketing Communications Specialist,Financial Services,2+ years,4,5,4,,,10,“An Organization Miracle for Remote Teams”,,12/12/2017,,"Cons: I don't like it that a team member has to be ""following"" a project to see updates. I think that the purpose of this feature is to limit the amount of project notifications that users receive to include only those that they follow - which is good. But there is no reminder once you add a project to the system that you need to add everyone that you want to see this project as a follower. So, members of my team (especially those who are new to Asana) will be leaving comments or questions on a project, not realizing that unless they add someone as a follower, no one will see their note."

No more emails back and forth, all of your communication related to a task or project is housed in one easy-to-view location. The app makes delegating projects a snap from where ever you are in the world. Track your progress toward meeting deadlines and tag projects for easy searching! It's so easy to copy projects from last year too! Thanks Asana for helping keep our team on track",3/11/2016,"Pros: The app is so easy to use, Asana is easy to teach even non-tech savvy team members, love that different groups can have access to specific projects. Email alerts let me know when something needs my attention without having to login. Tagging projects makes analysis a breeze, great price for this tool, so helpful for a large non-profit. Customer service is responsive and helpful. We utilize specific due dates for each task to help move projects along.","Cons: Sometime I have trouble finding items using the search feature but I may need additional training. Sometimes I have challenges seeing all projects for a specific team member (past due, upcoming), again, I may need more training/time to look into this."

I guess I like how comprehensive the feature set is-it makes the product very versatile and allows me to wear many hats (individual, team member, manager) easily. I use My Tasks every day to manage my own personal workload, all our team and 1:1 agendas are in Asana-our roadmap is even an Asana project! One of my favorite features is Advanced Search and more specifically making reports with its results. I've been able to use it for so many things, including reporting weekly KPIs and making reports where team members can self-assign tasks, which has been particularly helpful during internships where interns can assign themselves rather than waiting on being handed an assignment.","Cons: Sometimes Asana can be quite sluggish. If I could get the engineering team to do focus on one thing for a month or two, it would be to clean up the backend and speed things up."
173,173 Asana,Asana,Stephanie R.,Office Manager,Executive Office,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Perfect for Work from Home Times”,"Overall: We have been using Asana since before the COVID-19 pandemic forced our office to work from home, but in the past few months, it has really shown its worth. We are able to set up teams by clients, administrative task boards, and general product and client information. We're basically using this amazing software as CRM rather than investing in a SalesForce type product. Asana was easy to set up initially, and adding new users has been a breeze as well. Even our less tech savvy staff enjoy the fun graphics and ease of use.",11/6/2020,"Pros: Asana is easy to set up, easy to use, and very intuitive to our needs and setting up new users. Dashboards and the phone app make this product even easier to access.","Cons: The only con my team could come up with for Asana was their request of more colors. Don't let this fool you though, Asana is already colorful and has exciting graphics for completing tasks. My team was just being picky."
174,174 Asana,Asana,Meg B.,Tech Virtual Assistant,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,3,4,,,5,“Very acceptable PM software”,Overall: Frustrating at first to pull away from another PM software and learn it new but very happy with it once I was comfortable.,26/3/2020,"Pros: You can organize very deeply in Asana which is pretty crucial when you're working with remote teams as I do. With paid programs you get more optional custom fields which you can use to track progress. Asana provides a Kanban workboard flow, tasks and even a calendar type view - not all available on free though.","Cons: When you first start with Asana it can be very overwhelming. And if the administrator isn't well detailed and organized with tasks and projects, it can be even worse. Also, on one of my teams we'll be moving over to a competitor software and I'm so excited. It's got so many features that you find frustrating with Asana and other PM software. So, Asana may soon be a thing of my past."
175,175 Asana,Asana,Jacob E.,Growth Marketing Manager,Media Production,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Incredibly Productivity Tool”,"Overall: Asana is an incredible solution to people who need to create order in their work. I've used Asana for both personal and professional tasks, and I can definitely say, it serves both needs. More than just a fantastically built user experience on the platform interface, one of the things I enjoy most about Asana is the way it enables me to schedule my day. I write tasks down and schedule them for a random day in the future. Once I arrive to that day, I have a list of tasks to complete that day. Next, I review all of the tasks and based on priority, schedule them on an hour-by-hour basis for that day. It allows me to visualize all of my tasks for that day and also identify if I will be able to/not able to actually achieve all of those tasks.",18/2/2020,"Pros: There are so many things to be honest with you, but just to name a few: - Ability to schedule tasks on a recurring basis - Ability to schedule and visualize tasks by time in a day (helpful for time blocking) - Subtask functionality, where you have the ability to add multiple subtasks to a larger task which is the combination of smaller parts","Cons: This is really not such a big con, but in the 6 years I've used Asana, there have been 2-3 times where the platform was 100% down meaning I had no access to my tasks and literally had no clue what I had to be working on. Yes, I am that dedicated and dependent on Asana for my day-to-day work."
176,176 Asana,Asana,Lindsie B.,Office Manager,Hospitality,2+ years,5,4,4,,4,9,“Asana Keeps Me Organized”,"Overall: I used this software to develop task lists for recurring projects at my last job and it was one of the first things I asked for in my new job - it's my favorite way of staying organized. Breaking things out into projects with sub tasks, adding custom categories for sorting and indicating where things are in a process - it's invaluable.",18/12/2019,"Pros: The fact that I constantly have my to-do list at my fingertips - phone, computer, someone else's computer - and I can add things on the fly, sort my lists, add due dates, custom categories for sorting, keep track of my progress with notes, sync with my calendar, etc. the list goes on and on. As an office manager, stuff gets thrown my way all the time and it's usually never the same issue so this software is invaluable to me to keep myself organized and remember where I am in the follow up.","Cons: I wish I could assign two people to a task - I understand why the company chose not to make that decision, and it makes sense, but it would be a feature I would like. I also think coordinating with one off users out side of Asana could be a little more streamlined."
177,177 Asana,Asana,Erin V.,psychiatrist,Medical Practice,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Great program for handling all things in life!”,"Overall: I recommend Asana to anybody who will listen, particularly patients who have ADHD. It's a great way to keep things organized and make sure that you don't have to worry about things. Asana has you covered.",6/12/2019,"Pros: This helps me to manage my life - both personally and professionally. I can tag things in different ways. For example, if I have time to make phone calls, I can pull up all the phone call tasks that are on my list. If I'm doing private practice, I can pull up those tasks so I don't get overwhelmed by looking at my whole to do list.","Cons: It can get overwhelming, and it's annoying sometimes to have to keep assigning things to myself. I wish there were a default option."
178,178 Asana,Asana,Debbie B.,Marketing Consultant,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,,5,9,“Asana keeps Me Organized”,"Overall: My experience with Asana has been great. I use it to work with clients, too, and it's so helpful to have a place where all the various project tasks are assigned to people and with dates to go along with that. Plus we can communicate inside of Asana which keeps all the information together in one place and leads to fewer misunderstandings. It's my go-to software every time I have a new idea for a project - and that happens all the time. I'd rate my overall experience as excellent.",7/8/2019,"Pros: Oh my goodness... what do I like most about this software? Well, for starters, it allows me to dump all of my ideas out of my brain and into somewhere safe where I can keep them until I am ready to take action. Then, when I'm actively working on a project, it allows me to dump all the details into lists which I can assign to different people and keep track of. It's all about the details. I needed a place to document the details and turn them into repeatable processes and Asana allows me to do that with ease. Plus I love that it's on both my desktop and my phone, so I can access it anywhere.","Cons: There's not much I don't like. It does the job I need it to do. I only have the free version, so I don't really know what I'm missing by not having the upgrades, but for now I'm very happy with the functionality I have."
179,179 Asana,Asana,Trinidad Rebeca C.,UI & UX web designer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“A wonderful work management tool.”,"Overall: It helps to keep an order in all the personal and professional projects, they can be mixed in the same workspace, although they can also be carried separately, it is also very good for the project manager, since it allows them to organize their entire team of Work efficiently and monitor the progress of the project at any time.",10/7/2019,"Pros: Asana is a wonderful tool to manage projects, and work teams, in a simple and quite customizable way, what I like the most is that you can assign tasks, and subtasks in a personal way which allows you to take full control at all times, also the notifications system is quite specific, and configurable which facilitates being informed at all times of the changes in the projects, another feature that I like is the calendar, which allows to see more graphically all the tasks to be done, in addition to It also has a tab that allows you to see all available files in all projects, which facilitates access to them.","Cons: It is difficult to find something negative in this tool, since it is quite complete, the only detail to highlight is the large number of notifications that are sent, however these can be disabled in their majority, another question is that being so customizable and having So many functions the learning curve can be something steep."
180,180 Asana,Asana,Sharon S.,Director of Content Marketing & Integrated Planning,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Reliable tool for project management”,"Overall: Asana has helped improve visibility into and alignment around project management significantly. It makes it so our team has a clear place to go where all information and assignments lives to avoid confusion and miscommunications. It's helped us collaborate with contractors as well, which has been a huge success.",24/9/2020,"Pros: Asana is very user-friendly and intuitive to pick up, which makes it easy to get started using. It has a lot of great features for project management and collaboration, including basic ones like the ability to assign tasks, add due dates and leave comments, as well as more advanced ones like noting dependencies within projects. It's very helpful for keeping everyone aligned around tasks and timelines and creating a single source of truth for information on a project.","Cons: Asana has added a lot of new capabilities over the years that have really extended the functionality of the product. In particular, the addition of project templates for repeatable processes and dependent tasks have made this much better since the early days of the product. As a result, there is not really anything missing at this point."
181,181 Asana,Asana,Carissa A.,CEO,E-Learning,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Incredible Project Management Tool”,Overall:,24/6/2020,"Pros: I love the way you can hop into Asana and immediately implement its useful templates and project management tools. As a small business, I use it to not only organize myself, but my contractors at times, as well as a nonprofit organization I run. Even when using the free version, it can keep you on track and moving forward.","Cons: I wish it wasn't so expensive to use the pro versions of this tool. As a solopreneur, I can't justify paying as much for the spots, even if I'd like to have the Gantt Chart capabilities, etc."
182,182 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Best to organize your work”,"Overall: At some point in my life I figured out the need of some software to organize myself. Being an engineer I did what most engineers do: I swept through most of the top software like that. Nothing compared to Asana. Easy of use, functionality, features - all is there. All fit for my needs. I use Asana daily to organize my tasks in the getting-things-done framework. At the same time I advocate to my students to start using it when working on projects - simply because I know it works. Great product.",10/6/2020,Pros: - ease of use - ease of onboarding - clear UI - lots of features - great customization - ease of teamwork,"Cons: At some moments Asana is a bit too candy-like. I understand that ""having fun"" is a part of workflow now, but when marking an engineering task done, I do not feel the need to see a smiling unicorn giving me a thumbs-up."
183,183 Asana,Asana,Cynthia M.,Graphic Designer,Real Estate,2+ years,5,4,4,3,4,9,“Great project tracking tool. Love it!”,"Overall: Asana helps my team stay organized and communicative with each other on a daily basis. Its a great tool to keep everyone accountable and aware of project status, due dates, extra notes, etc. We wouldn't be able to function as efficiently as a team without it",10/10/2019,Pros: I like how easy it is to see all your tasks at once and how you can filter completed/uncompleted tasks. It's so easy to organize your day with this program. I love that when you check off a task sometimes an image flies across the screen,"Cons: It doesn't always integrate well with other plug ins such as Toggl, I find that part glitches and my Toggl button disappears."
184,184 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Get Things Done”,Overall: Asana has helped me tremendously stay on top of many crucial high visibility projects being implemented simultaneously. I can see better visibility as to what needs to happen now so we don't have scope creep later or fall behind. Highly recommend using Asana if you manage people or projects or have tasks you need to accomplish,21/11/2018,"Pros: Asana works great to help you get done what needs to be done today and schedule what needs to happen tomorrow or next month or next year. I've used Asana to manage many project implementations with team members. I really like the ability to easily create new projects, assign a task to someone on my team as well as put a detailed description and attachments on the task. As you or your resources work on the task; attachments and comments can be added to see progress and track what need to be done. It's been very helpful in monitoring my team meet deadlines and see what tasks need more attention",Cons: There are times when there is a slight delay in responsiveness; which is acceptable since it is a web based application. Also there are times when I've had a new blank task created by mistake due to a bit of lag; it's easy enough to delete or mark the blank task complete that it doesn't interfere that much.
185,185 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,3,3,2,3,6,“Good but could be better.”,Overall:,24/9/2020,Pros: I like that this software allows you to edit tasks lists in a way that work for the specific project. Also the templates for projects are a HUGE HELP.,"Cons: The general user experience can be imporved. Theres a lot of focus on innovation but it feels like there some simple customer service requests that can be added. For example, if you want to go back to a team via project, there's no button within that task listing. Can be a pain."
186,186 Asana,Asana,Stephanie G.,Technical Analyst II,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,5,3,5,9,“My experience with Asana”,"Overall: It is quite easy to use, it is affordable, its free version is very good and the price paid for a more complete performance is fair. I think it's great to have a multifunctional workspace where we can assign tasks and create sets for a project where we can sort, track and tag them. We all go at the same pace where no one is missing anything, productivity and participation increase.",26/6/2020,"Pros: Asana is one of the best task managers, besides being considered with the benefits of its free and paid version, I consider it has a fair price compared to others, besides the possibilities and freedom offered by the pro version is worth paying for a more complex business performance. I really like this software because it has all kinds of access, I can enter from the web and also with my mobile application. We are all in harmony as we can collaborate in the same place without boring emails and notes that are then lost, it is easy to create a group and invite people to a project. Having control and a complete view of the activities is very important.","Cons: Its user interface is a bit simple as it is not a very fast software. But because of its virtues, which are more than its disadvantages, I still consider it a wonderful working tool."

I feel it has increased my productive and overall effectiveness.",10/6/2020,"Pros: Asana is user friendly, the interface is bright and makes you feel happy and welcome while using it.",Cons: Anytime I think I find a feature that needs to be added an update happens and poof the thing I needed appears!

As mentioned we switched from ActiveCollab to asana due to company policy, but we didn't find what we were looking for. We used it for some time (3-4 months I believe) and then we went back to ActiveCollab during the lifetime of the project.",25/2/2020,"Pros: How easy it was to create tasks and subtasks, and start a discussion about a particular task or item.",Cons: Lack of features. Many project management features are missing. There was no easy way to create and manage milestones and no views like a dashboard that will give you valuable data about the progress and project status.
189,189 Asana,Asana,Ryan C.,Business Intelligence Analyst,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Best Task and Project Management Software Out There”,Overall: Asana is very customizable and adapatable to the way I work and manage projects. Asana is constantly updating its features and services to ensure that its customer's needs are met.,7/1/2020,"Pros: It is so easy to customize, integrate, and work with this software. I use it every day and love it. My projects and tasks are easily tracked and viewed in the platform. There are also some great features to utilize to increase your productivity and visualization of your work load.",Cons: I cannot think of many things that I don't like about the platform. It is a great tool and price points may be the only thing but I think the value I gain from it is well worth the price.
190,190 Asana,Asana,Jeremy G.,Instructional Designer,Automotive,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,10,“Switched From Trello to Asana”,"Overall: Asana let me organize my projects on one ""board"". Each card is a project (vs. a task is the board is the project). The ability to create subtasks, due dates for them, etc... really makes Asana a powerful too for organizing and prioritizing. The free version is quite good as well and some will never need more than the basic offerings.",26/11/2019,"Pros: Free to use (limited functions). Asana lets me set up my board how I want. I REALLY like that I can assign Subtasks (and tasks w/in subtasks), assign them to a person and give each subtask a due date. This allows for each task to look cleaner and not get a huge laundry list of check boxes. The timeline feature is really cool too.",Cons: There is a little bit of a learning curve but once you figure out how to use the program to fit your needs its very intuitive. Can be expensive if you have larger teams.
191,191 Asana,Asana,Shannon L. P.,CEO/Owner,Management Consulting,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Sanity for Free”,Overall: Asana has helped me herd all of my tasks into one place. This not only keeps me organized but also keeps me honest when I have too much on my plate and helps me easily delegate or outsource tasks.,16/10/2019,"Pros: It's easy to dump my 1,000,000 ideas and tasks into a platform that is flexible and keeps me organzied.","Cons: I love the software. Occasionally the interface is glitchy, but it's not a deal breaker."
192,192 Asana,Asana,David C.,Assistant Director,Government Administration,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“Asana Review”,"Overall: We have been using Asana for about 18 months and decided to upgrade to Premium about 5 months ago so that we could bring more users into the system. We like the flexibility to use the system in a variety of ways. For example, we share some projects across departments to help communicate and collaborate on items of mutual interest. We also have created a project to track staff meeting action items and upcoming deadlines. We do struggle at times with how wide open the system is - things can get a bit messy at times - but in the end, I think the flexibility is what makes the system so powerful. We really like features such as tags, custom fields, and great search functions. We also like the dashboards, though we wish that they didn't take up quite as much real estate on the screen so that we could see more dashboards at one time. One of the biggest challenges is getting folks to use the system more fully, especially when people already have systems that they use to track their work. We have tried to focus on projects that benefit from frequent collaboration for success so that people will get value from using Asana to track and share details about work.",3/11/2016,"Pros: Flexibility. Simplicity. Assigning and scheduling work. Interesting integrations. Calendar, conversations and dashboards. Favorites.","Cons: Not a big fan of 'hearts' in our professional setting. I get it, but some of our most senior staff don't really appreciate the symbol. This will change over time, but in the meantime it has created somewhat of a barrier to some people adopting the system."
193,193 Asana,Asana,Chris B.,Chief Executive,51-200 employees,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“The productivity tool that has liberated us to do more ”,"Overall: I had begun using Asana as a personal task management tool some time ago, but its real strength has come into play now that we use it across our organisation. As a small conservation charity/NGO we have a dispersed workforce of dedicated colleagues that need to work closely together across a range of functions. Asana has been the missing element that has enabled us to work more effectively and more efficiently, delivering real conservation impact. We have just used Asana to plan and implement both a major international conservation meeting attendance; managing our work in advance and whilst there in real time, with a team spread across several continents. At the same time the same team were able to handle a major investigation into a wildlife trade issue. We no longer have to rely on bilateral and multi-recipient emails from which we would often miss the very people who needed to know 'this and that', but we could now rely on a system that allowed us intuitively to keep each other informed and to be clear about who was tasked with what. This ability to take responsibility whilst having true accountability to undertake a task has liberated us to be able to concentrate on what is important and not what issue seemed the most urgent at that particular moment. We are still uncovering the attributes of Asana, and I love the fact that it does not try to do everything, but what we do need it does exceptionally well. I am particularly impressed with the roll out of new customer responsive features such as custom fields. All in all, a great product that does exactly what we needed and has helped us change the way we work for the better.",3/11/2016,Pros: best team productivity tool,Cons: cannot merge calendars

Further, Asana has had an immense and beneficial effect on our teams ability to hire, task assign, track progress, and ultimately complete our projects on a timely basis. We have as a result seen our productivity increase. We can absolutely with confidence recommend Asana to support and build your business as it has ours.",12/8/2020,"Pros: Asana is a quick and organized project management tool that allows our team to establish communication lines per task. We love Asana's capability to integrate seamlessly with Google drive for ease of setup. Team members can further attach messages and progress reports per task which significantly reduces email volume and keeps us on target as we progress on a timeline. Each team member can collect new tasks in Asana and organize by priority . This is accomplished by plotting these tasks in the ""upcoming ""section. We love Asana's ""Boards"" capability which allows a visual catalog presentation that obviates the need for other software applications for this function. We want to stress that the mobile version for Asana is easy to deploy and offers a fluid portable solution to task presentation and completion.","Cons: Some have said that the ""Team Transparency "" is a too granular view on assignments and on task progress , however these functions are exactly why our team selected Asana."
195,195 Asana,Asana,amiya d.,Senior User Experience Designer,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,3,4,4,8,“A Platform for Managing Projects Professionally”,"Overall: It helps you to easily find details, plans, files, feedback and many more about projects through its improved collaboration. It helps in mapping out goals and prioritizing your tasks so that you do not have to miss your deadlines of tasks.

It provides various collaboration tools which allow the user to coordinate with each other and communicate with other team members so that everyone knows about what other team members are doing. It helps in providing a complete view of teamwork. It provides real-time updates about reports, tasks and progress of teamwork.",Cons:  Task views should be more improved. Its mobile app has limited functions. Its exporting features are not helpful and reliable. Sometimes you are not able to view everything in which you are tagged in. It does not allow you to create your own custom icons. It does not auto-clear your project once it is completed.
196,196 Asana,Asana,Krista J.,Digital Project Assistant,Health,2+ years,5,4,4,,,9,“Asana Review”,,15/7/2020,,"Cons: I am not a fan of how the software works in tiers. It makes it a little difficult to collaborate with other parts of the team (which was mentioned by CS). I would love if there was a secondary owner of a task instead of just a collaborator - sometimes 2 people are owners of the task and it will not show up in their calendar/task list as a collaborator. I wish that the subtasks were shown in portfolios etc. and you did not have to add it to a project in order for it to track progress - we run a lot of campaigns and create tasks with a lot of subtasks, if tasks could work similarly to projects that would be amazing. Reviewing work is great but you cannot zoom into images that are being reviewed which is a little annoying."

It's built in such a way that users can learn features intuitively, no training required. The interface is well designed, the features well though out and it's fast and easy to use. My team picked it up quickly and have been using it to manage marketing campaigns and projects very successfully.",Cons: The only negatives I've seen so far is feature creep. Asana have started adding some useful new features but need to be really careful not to overdo it and overcomplicate the tool.

This feature definitely needs more development."

When I am looking for a new solution, they come out with a new feature. It's incredibly helpful in the way we manage our team.",9/6/2020,"Pros: I love how straightforward it is - and how it allows us to see not only what the priorities are for our team, but the priorities for the entire organization.

Dress easy to arrange and offers a lot of preparation. The format is splendid and brilliant, which is more pleasant than watching a dull spreadsheet.",11/4/2020,"Pros: I like the comfort of this program. I incline toward the assistance we got once we had issues. Easy to utilize. Viable for ordinary use. Simple to utilize and that I jumped at the chance to determine what others were performing on and teaming up with each other. Asana is that the ideal stage to clearly and simply watch various surges of adventures and timetables of assignments for all customers, interfacing everyone to in any occasion one spot where a planned exertion.","Cons: All the highlights and alternatives, which are wonderful furthermore, can nearly cause the framework to appear to be excessively mind-boggling and refined for everyday use. Since there are various functionalities it is frequently overpowering design the ideal venture scope for your group."
201,201 Asana,Asana,Thu-Lynn N.,Director of Marketing,Financial Services,2+ years,4,3,5,3,,8,“Great (and free) PM software for small marketing teams”,Overall:,26/3/2020,"Pros: Extremely easy to use PM software that has hundreds of integrations. Asana by itself is a pretty good platform; however, the integrations are where it's elevated. My team used Polly (for polls), Google Sheet (for Google integrations), Outlook integration and Harvest (time tracking). I like the ability to tag, assign tasks and that the platform is always improving.","Cons: This review is for the free version. It gets clunky very easily and doesn't have conditional tasks & dependencies (unless you're on a paid version). The clunkiness comes from the subtasks for each project, which easily can be overwhelming because of the way it's setup. The one thing I hate about the free version is that termed employees or short-term contractors will always be in the system and you cannot remove their name (even if you removed their access). Just seeing there names on the left panel where the team is listed can be somewhat cringy."
202,202 Asana,Asana,John W.,Key Account Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,5,4,4,7,“An Enterprise Solution for Project Management”,Overall: We are a multi-city SaaS business helping solve some of the most technical data in compliance. Asana has helped align our teams for several of our product lines ensuring that everyone from our Sales Team to our Developers are on the same page.,16/3/2020,"Pros: Asana is a very thorough and detailed oriented platform. The customization to how you personally view your projects, to-do's and even the tasks within each to-do is truly valuable and very helpful. I like how collaborative the tool is with each communication thread, doc storage and assigning tasks is visible to all members on each project. This makes for a very accountable workflow and visibility into what each person is doing",Cons: My biggest con would be the learning curve. Asana is very thorough and has so many layers to its functionality. With that comes a steep learning curve and some possible confusion amongst teams as to how each team member uses the different layers of each Project. Internally there would have to be some excellent training and onboarding to ensure uniform usage of the platform for effective project management for teams.
203,203 Asana,Asana,Daniel B.,COO,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Fantastic productivity tool for work and life”,"Overall: Fantastic experience, it has helped me stay organized, replaced my need for handwritten to-do lists, syncs across all my devices, and clues my team into what I am working on all the time, and vice-versa.",15/1/2020,"Pros: Asana helps me keep track of everything I do in my life, from crucial project deadlines to customer follow-up reminders to when I need to get my next haircut. It has completely replaced the use of my calendar as a to-do reminder tool, instead making it what it should be, a simple record of what I am doing when. I have tried tons of to-do list apps and reminder tools and none is as flexible yet simple as Asana, and because it's built for teams, it scales fantastically beyond just my personal use.","Cons: I have no complaints. Asana is highly functional, and the only feature I'd perhaps want is better prioritization ability beyond just due dates."
204,204 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,E-Learning,2+ years,5,5,5,,,8,“Recently returned to Asana - They continue to improve”,"Overall: Asana, the 3 times I've used it for project work, has always impressed me for how effective and perfect for the web - project management software can be. I welcome the opportunity to use it again with a future client.",6/1/2020,Pros: The live Gahnt charting and task planning features that allow you to easily share with a small team is an unbelievable value for me as a freelancer. I can keep my client updated on my work plan easily.,Cons: The cost if my team grew beyond 3 users would be prohibitive. But the features are starting to exceed that of Microsoft Project and the subscription model for these ever increasing features may be worth it.
205,205 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Games,2+ years,4,5,4,,,9,“Easy Way to Get Your Team Organized”,"Overall: Before we implemented Asana into our team project we were having redundancies all over the place. Communication was poor as we were collaborating with several other university departments, and there was a lot of wasted time. Wasted time is wasted money. After deciding to use Asana and getting familiar with it we were able to cut out 50% of our meetings with Asana's synced to-do lists. We were able to customize it to fit our needs and my supervisor could oversee our employees from other departments and facilitate communication between all of us. Asana gave us the efficiency we desperately needed.",27/12/2019,Pros: Asana gave us a quick and efficient solution to our organization problem. Instead of endless meetings between several departments we started using Asana's management tools. Asana gave us synced to-do lists in one easy location between all of us. Our tasks started to get completed faster and we weren't doing things twice. It also allowed us to work more independently which saved a lot of our time and helped our project take shape faster.,"Cons: At times Asana can get a little glitchy, I have had tasks that I checked off reappear. But nothing too major. I also think the dashboard interface could be a little more simple to make navigation even quicker. I also think customizable features could be easier to find."
206,206 Asana,Asana,Lauren H.,Marketing Strategist,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Simple & Effecient”,"Overall: Asana helps us manage client deliverables, due dates, and keeps everyone informed of what other people on the team are doing. As a manager, its helpful to see what's being accomplished on a day to day basis.",3/12/2019,Pros: Its ability to be integrated with time-tracking software (like Everhour) so that you can manage your time and tasks all in one place. There seem to be a lot of integrations (not all that I have explored) for this software making it even more cross-functional and integrated into workflow.,Cons: The worst part about Asana is the feeling of living in your task list... our organization has an insurmountable number of daily tasks per team member and the switch to red can induce stress that might not actually be needed.
207,207 Asana,Asana,Sara O.,Copywriter,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,2,3,,,5,“Not my favorite project management software”,"Overall: It's amazing to have project management software, and if you aren't using one yet - I HIGHLY recommend getting one. It will change your life. It's awesome to be able to input a client and have all their information in one place, then assign tasks as needed and set deadlines so you don't forget. While I highly recommend getting project management software and I have listed it as an option to friends who ask for recommendations, my personal favorite is still Basecamp.",25/10/2019,"Pros: I love that it's easy to assign tasks to other people, tag posts, and make parent tasks that have subtasks related to them. I also love, and this seems like a silly thing but some applications don't have it, that when you click a link it opens up in a new webpage - not taking you away from your work","Cons: It may just be the way the company I work with uses it, but Asana seems extremely cluttered without delivering the key information. Why doesn't it show me overdue tasks on the homepage? Why do I have to click around to find the tasks that should be front and center? Why can't I easily find a record of work I've completed? My company has us assign the task to the next person who needs to review it instead of completing the task - which means I get endless notifications about tasks I completed days ago and no record of what tasks I recently worked on. It's very frustrating when I am trying to look at what I have spent my time on."
208,208 Asana,Asana,Rachel G.,Marketing Coordinator,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,10,“Essential for organising team work orders!”,Overall: Marketing workflow,21/7/2019,"Pros: I love that it has a mobile app. I love that multiple people can work in it, and that changes are tracked along with who implemented the change. The ability to keep all project information and communication in one place is vital - we don't have to email or keep file folders or anything of that sort, a project can be entirely run through asana.",Cons: Difficult to bring customers into project communication. Difficult for customers to send in work orders or track progress.
209,209 Asana,Asana,Jeremy G.,Electronics Engineer,Military,2+ years,4,3,4,,4,7,“Takes post-it project wall to a medium-service level”,"Overall: I had started with Trello for some few business and home project management but thought I would like to include some more project management features. I think it ended up being more than I needed, and for the relatively few and simple projects, Asana wasn't worth the difficulty. But I can see that in increasing the projects and their complexity, especially if they can be structured and repeated, Asana would be an excellent step up. And despite me feeling the complexity of its features, it is more flexible than a full-features project management approach or system that I've used for work, so is a good in-between and saves time. It can work as a trusted system (as described by CSR), which is a plus, but as with all self-management, personal preferences are a major component and I found Asana both too complex and clunky to enjoy its regular use. But for the right kind of person and the right kind of projects, it can be extremely useful.",27/4/2019,"Pros: If you like and need a general breadth of project management features, then Asana is definitely a choice to try. It takes the post-it project wall (done well by Trello) to a more complete level, with timelines, calendars, milestones tracking, and task and project relational handling. Plus all that you would expect from a cloud-based service with add-ins for other services linking. For handling a slew of tasks and projects that are relatively structured and repeated, this is definitely an excellent source.","Cons: There was a bit of a learning curve and many features did not feel intuitive - so seemingly not how other software I've used works, and thus is more of a commitment to make it work. There were also a slew of small annoyances in using and moving between the features like having to close dialogue boxes directly instead of just clicking elsewhere."
210,210 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Very complete and powerful project manager for team work. ”,,20/4/2019,,"Cons: Conversations can be spread in multiple tasks and subtasks. It is not necessarily bad, but it will require some kind of etiquette shared between the users. Tasks links are long and have random numbering. If you intend to use this as an issue manager (and then you must link the task to a repository like VCS, Git, etc.) you may want to use your own manual numbering for issues."
211,211 Asana,Asana,Shayne H.,Director of Sales,Internet,2+ years,4,4,3,5,4,8,“Best Task Management App I've ever used!”,"Overall: Whether you're a large enterprise or a start-up with a few employees, Asana will make your life way easier. Asana was introduced to me by an ex-colleague of mine who was heading a Sales team in a different company. I was amazed by the utility it added to the functionality and productivity of my team. I had to try it first to believe it. I suggest you should too.",17/2/2019,"Pros: 1) Asana makes keeping track of projects and tasks very convenient. 2) It is very user-friendly. I say this because when I implemented the use of Asana in my company, I found that many individuals with varying technological proficiencies started learning the basic features and worked on it without any hassles. 3) It is very easy to create and manage multiple projects across multiple departments. 4) I've realized that meeting deadlines have become easier now, given the fact that I can track all progress in a real-time environment. 5) Asana's mobile client is helpful when I'm on the go. 6) Last, but definitely not the least, Asana lets me ""visualize"" my work, literally, thereby helping me move tasks through different stages quickly and easily.","Cons: To be honest, there's not much that I didn't like about Asana, given the fact that I've been using the free version for the first two years and then ultimately switching to their paid version. However, if I look at things with a more detailed approach, these are the cons I can highlight:- 1) Setting up privacy settings is a bit of a tricky task. 2) When I tried to duplicate a product, I noticed that the notes weren't carried over. (Not a big deal, I know) 3) I wish they had a chat function within the interface. That would be pretty kool."
212,212 Asana,Asana,Nick T.,CEO,1-10 employees,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Great for Team Projects”,,11/5/2018,,"Cons: The only thing that may be a Pro or a Con is that EVERYBODY gets notified even for communication for a specific team member. This may sometimes be a hassle when there are a lot of team members in one project who are in constant communication. With all the notifications of everyone coming in, your email's inbox can get a bit messy. There's a way around to ""private messaging"" but it totally defeats the purpose of getting everyone in the loop. It may help if there's a function for team members to choose the option of getting the notification or not when he/she is not mentioned."
213,213 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,5,5,3,3,5,9,“We use this task management software to track projects among multiple employees and devices.”,Overall: Clean easy to use task tracker across multiple hardware platforms.,19/3/2018,"Pros: Clean, intuitive, easy to use. The layout is nice, not too cluttered but has the option to add notes and comments to dig down deeper into tasks. I really like that I can use Asana across a variety of devices. I can do the heavy lifting on my laptop, then access all of projects/tasks/comments/etc. on the go from my phone.","Cons: At my organization the API calls and automated task creation is taken advantage of quite a bit. What I've found is that if it's too easy for people to automate project/task creations, then you'll end up with people sending you a flood of too many tasks where often some of them aren't necessary or have already been taken care of. Try to avoid over complicating Asana. Avoid anyone who claims to be a ""Power User"". In my experience these people are creating giant complex file structures inside of Asana and completely ruining the simple intuitive layout that exists out of the box. Projects are good for housing tasks, but don't get carried away. If you're spending as much time organizing and listing your tasks as you are completing them, you aren't productive."
214,214 Asana,Asana,Meredith T.,Territory Account Manager,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,9,“Asana is increasingly gaining ground as a leader in project management.”,"Overall: It is a flexible software, friendly with the applications of daily use so that you can integrate without problems and synchronize in a more complete way your information, it is an excellent way to work orderly and professionally, with an ideal structure and interface, to have control of your projects and to have access to a space where everybody can work and share ideas is very easy with Asana.",28/6/2020,"Pros: I love using Asana because all the information and my work is in the cloud, which means I can log in from any of my devices, like my tablet, cell phone or computer and just log in with my account, I don't have to worry about losing something or not being able to access it from somewhere remotely, it's great. All Asana's presentations are good, from any platform it works very well for me. I work with group task implementation and sub-tasks with my team, it's much better to collaborate by this means than everyone on their own, it's easy to use. We can communicate and manage the activities and projects in an orderly and unanimous way.","Cons: There's nothing I don't like about Asana, but the features offered for the free version could be more attractive and less limited (although for medium to small workflow it's not bad at all) since the costs for the premium versions increase considerably if we talk about Asana Business."
215,215 Asana,Asana,Jacob O.,Paid Media Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana Review”,Overall:,26/6/2020,Pros: I love the ability to easily make projects and assign specific tasks for those projects is my favorite. I also love being able to see all of the different tasks in the calendar view as well as the timeline view. It is also very easy to add people/assign people to tasks and projects.,Cons: The biggest thing I wish Asana had would be some kind of time management or time tracking for each task or project.
216,216 Asana,Asana,Lillian G.,Customer Service Representative,Food & Beverages,2+ years,5,4,5,5,4,9,“With Asana our team stays organized”,"Overall: Dress easy to arrange and offers a lot of preparation. The design is splendid and beautiful, which is more pleasant than watching a dull spreadsheet. I incline toward that we will see the status of undertakings that we are working together on. It assists bosses with the following advancement. we in reality simply like the stage yet have made some troublesome memories actualizing inside our group.",9/4/2020,"Pros: For the principal part, I really like Asana. huge amounts of it come directly down to how your organization has discovered Asana. In the event that there are no reasonable conventions, things get extremely chaotic. The stage's free arrangement is very powerful. It enables little groups with an espresso to spending plan. There additionally are a lot of modules and reconciliations, for example, Salesforce.","Cons: As this is frequently an extremely strong instrument, the tasks can turn out to be exceptionally mind-boggling. Now and again the errands are constraining and just permit one to dole out to at any rate one individual. Asana is frequently truly befuddling if things aren't discovered in straightforward gratitude to comprehension. I once in a while stray inside undertakings and assignments."
217,217 Asana,Asana,Maija P.,Operations Associate,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,4,,,7,"“Good for task management, wish Slack integration was a little better”",Overall: Asana allows my company to assign tasks to other team members and keep record of those tasks to ensure completion. The due date and email reminder features allows a way of ensuring that tasks get done on time and don't get forgotten about.,26/1/2020,"Pros: I like that Asana can be integrated with Slack, making it easy to create task for other team members directly from Slack channels. I also like that I can follow tasks I've created so I know what the status of those task are. I also like that it is possible to create private projects for sensitive information. Being able to search for tasks also lets me see if someone else has already created a similar task, so I'm not duplicating work.","Cons: While I like that Asana supports integration with Slack, I dislike that there is not an option to format the task precisely as I would like to. When creating tasks in Asana, it is possible to add input fields in order to ensure all necessary information related to the task is entered correctly, however when creating tasks from Slack, these customized fields are not available, so the information is not as complete or well organized as it is when creating in Asana."
218,218 Asana,Asana,Lauren C.,Event Planner,Events Services,2+ years,4,4,5,3,5,10,"“Best for teams, hard for a solo entrepreneur”",Overall:,10/1/2020,"Pros: Asana is EXCELLENT for working in teams. The thing I liked most about it was the ability to create project status updates without everything cluttering email boxes. It helped keep documents organized, which I really loved.",Cons: It's not a great tool to use for a solo entrepreneur and it takes a while to understand all the features. Daily use is important or else you won't keep the habit of using it as a system
219,219 Asana,Asana,Sean O.,Sr. Associate Director of Web Communications,Online Media,2+ years,5,4,4,,,10,“Great Project Management Tool”,"Overall: It's a great tool to manage your projects, and to keep you and your team on task. I like to use Asana to keep track of projects that I've finished, those that are ongoing, and projects I plan on working on in the future.",5/12/2019,"Pros: Fantastic project management and collaboration tool. It allows you to assign tasks to team members, set due dates, and communicate with anyone tracking a project. It's also a great tool for keeping track of personal projects and general to-do lists.","Cons: It's a little difficult to use at first. The user interface is a little confusing, until you have practice with it and you understand the basic concepts."
220,220 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,5,4,4,8,"“Great product, bit tricky to learn”","Overall: I prefer Asana to Jira and Monday.com, it's a lot cleaner and less overwhelming. Even though there is a lot to learn, once you know the basics you can use the tool efficiently.",5/11/2019,Pros: There is so much Asana can do. We use this tool within our marketing team to have visibility on what everyone in the team is doing. It's easy to collaborate with other team members and makes project management easier.,"Cons: There's so much to learn that it can be overwhelming. Also, my teammates are continually commenting on tasks - these comments often get lost if there is more than 4. It can be annoying when we mark a task as complete on one board and it will mark it complete on all - sometimes it's just been completed by one team, not all of them!"
221,221 Asana,Asana,Khabele M.,CEO / Founder,Retail,2+ years,4,4,4,,,6,"“Seems good, but not for me”",,20/10/2019,,Cons: 1) Too complicated for my use - I felt projects got overly complex / confusing. I didn't need all the features. Sometimes I just wanted a simple way to manage a project and Asana isn't good for that. 2) Can only assign project tasks to ONE person (at least when I used it). Would be useful to sign to multiple people.
222,222 Asana,Asana,Jennifer T.,COO,Real Estate,2+ years,4,4,4,,,9,“Excellent Project Management Tool”,Overall: I have found Asana to be a very useful tool in our business. We wouldn't operate our business as efficiently without it.,11/10/2019,"Pros: My favorite feature of Asana is its ability to manage assignments for our team and to never miss a deadline or forget an important step. Our teams can communicate with one another in Asana. We can instantly see the status of any project. We can set up custom task templates so that we can work on similar projects without needing to ""reinvent the wheel"" each time. Another great benefit of Asana it that Asana integrates with many other programs and platforms including all Google products, Slack, Chrome, various billing programs, etc.","Cons: Asana lacks a built-in CRM and does not have the ability to share project updates with anyone outside of the organization or team (e.g., our clients)."
223,223 Asana,Asana,Laura B.,Design Coordinator,Real Estate,2+ years,5,5,4,3,4,7,“Asana Review”,Overall: I really love Asana! We are learning more and more every day of how we can use it in our everyday tasks at work. It keeps everyone organized and accountable to complete their assigned tasks by a particular due day! It also helps keep yourself organized and allows you to prepare yourself for what you have to accomplish week to week.,30/9/2019,Pros: It's a super easy tool for me to plan out my designers days! I can easily get a snapshot of what their day looks like and if I need to move things around when they are too business,Cons: There was recently an update that changed the format of the tasks and in order to add a tag (which we do for every task) you have to open the task up. Whereas you use to be able to do so without.
224,224 Asana,Asana,Warner B.,Senior Project Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana has been popularly recognized as one of the most reliable project management tool”,Overall: Asana is easy to use and user-friendly tool with all the required features necessary for every organization. I highly recommend this tool to every professional individual for keeping a track of all the office activities and to stay updated with the project progress.,4/6/2019,Pros: Asana has multi options and endless features for managing the projects and the team in the most efficient ways. We can also monitor all the activities and prospects of an ongoing project. It let us thoroughly examine the whole progress of the projects with friendly user-interface. It is quite user friendly and every new user can easily learn and enjoy the work on it. It is a much suitable tool for small or large organizations equipped with all kind of reliable tools. It also offers great ways for collaboration.,"Cons: It takes lot of time to setup in the initial stages. It requires more intense efforts towards setting up the frame-line for the new projects. I also once encountered a major technical issue while using the tool but the customer service offers an excellent support towards my problem. Overall, we can count on this tool for our hustle free project management."
225,225 Asana,Asana,Erica R.,Account Supervisor,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,4,4,,9,“Efficient Cross-Department Project Management Tool”,"Overall: My overall experience has been very positive. Asana has allowed me to manage project progress across departments, within teams and even with the client. I've used several similar project management tools and Asana is by far my top pick.",5/3/2019,"Pros: Asana's UI is one of my favorite parts about the platform. It's very user-friendly and makes creating teams, tasks, projects and customizations straightforward and simple. A feature I commonly use is the ""dependency"" assignment that allows visibility into how tasks or projects are tied together, noting if one step must be complete before another can be. It's also a great way to keep up with conversations and the progress of a task or project.","Cons: The only thing I've run into that's been less than ideal is that you can use custom fields on sub-tasks if they are in use for the parent-task. For example, if you want to set an hour estimate for an overall project that has three sub-tasks, those three sub-tasks can't have the hour estimate field as well. There a ways around this, like notating the hour estimates in brackets in the sub-task's name, etc. but I'm hoping a platform update in the future will allow for this."

227,227 Asana,Asana,Daniel Y.,Creative Director,Design,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“Best Project/Task Management Tool”,"Overall: I've tried many different Project and Tasks management tools (from classic spreadsheets to Microsoft Project, To-Do list apps, Trello... just to name a couple) and Asana as by far the most robust, flexible and complete platform out there. Basically, you can adapt it to any Project Management method you like, Waterfall, Agile, Kanban, and so on. With Asana, you can create Projects, and each Project can have Sections, Tasks and Sub-Tasks. Each one of these can be assigned to a member of the team, and also include collaborators. Each tasks can hold entire conversations and file attachments inside. Also, its abbility to integrate with many different third-party apps lets you create the digital environment that your team needs: You can connect it with InstaGantt to get dynamic Gantt Diagrams of your entire project, use it with Everhour, Harvest or WorkingOn to track and report time on every task, integrate it with Slack or Hipchat to push task updates and conversations into your chat channels... and even connect it with feedback bugtracking tools like TrackDuck and Usersnap. About its price: they offer both a free, very complete, plan individuals and small teams (up to 10 members) and paid accounts starting at $9 per user, which is an incredible plan for all this functionality.",3/11/2016,Pros: - Cloud collaboration - Third-party Integrations - Easy to learn - Flexible - Mobile App - Offers a free plan - Pro plans very affordable - Really nice UI,Cons: - Ir could be a little bit faster on the browser - It would be great if they'd offer a Desktop App for offline syncing.

Due to its power and complexity, it can take some time to get familiar with all of its capabilities and how to navigate it. Thankfully, the Asana Guide does an awesome job of guiding new users through the basics and advanced features. Beyond that, some of the UI is a little more complicated than it needs to be... but that's a minor complaint at best."
229,229 Asana,Asana,KELLY H.,director of Marketing,Real Estate,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“streamlines all processes”,Overall: I enjoy working with this product as it is easy to assign products and collaborate as well as brainstorm ideas about projects we are working on. I appreciate that it integrates with several different tools that we utilize as well,9/10/2020,"Pros: ease of use, fluidity and integration into other apps. The notifications are always consistent and delivered unlike other software I have used",Cons: email notifications provide a less-than-desirable summary of notifications. I wish to email would not force me to sign into the app every time to read a comment from one of my team members
230,230 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Venture Capital & Private Equity,2+ years,4,4,4,,3,8,“New goals feature a big deal”,,14/9/2020,,"Cons: It is difficult to create routines that include subtasks. Eg, if the user creates a ""morning routine"" task with 8 subtasks that is set recur each weekday, then the user's task list, inbox, and calendar is inundated with this info. We have had better luck using Trello for routine tasks (w/ Planyway) and use Asana for projects (non-routine)."

I basically use it to help me keep track of everything I need to track.",23/7/2020,"Pros: They say that when you have a hammer, every problem is a nail. Well, Asana is my new hammer! I love the flexibility of it for managing not only projects but tracking things like interview questions for candidates and onboarding steps for employees. I use it professionally and also personally to manage my blog and the varied steps involved with each post. I can't imagine having to work without it.",Cons: I use the paid version at work and the free version at home because I can't justify the cost for my hobby. There are several tiers - the first paid tier just doesn't give me enough to justify it over the free version. The versions I would love to use is way too expensive for this purpose.

Spared huge amounts of your time and disarray. Asana includes an incredible looking interface and makes it amusing to utilize. Portable usefulness functions admirably as well. There are numerous choices for an errand and group executives. The sync between clients or different gadgets is extremely quick.",18/5/2020,"Pros: I extremely simply like the Asanas interface and choices to make separate ventures and utilize one Account to adjust effectively between ventures. Generally speaking, Asana looks extraordinary and possibly a decent arrangement venture coordinated effort yet can make point by point the executives hard with its absence of errand properties and sub-task usefulness.","Cons: Asana is confounding to utilize at first. Sub-undertakings are frequently relegated cutoff times however these cutoff times don't appear inside the primary card see or send a mindful of the doled out a colleague. Information shared inside assignments naturally makes enormous errand spread pictures, making it harder to peruse the group board."

Therefore it poses a question on value for money - if you need to use another tool for more complex projects, why not stay with the other tool?",20/4/2020,Pros: The ability to add subtasks and attachments to tasks easily (in the latest versions of the app) without changing pages.,"Cons: There is a limit to the information that can be attached or reviewed from within the app. This forces people to collaborate on decision-making using other apps that also offer a two-level task capability, thus driving them away from using it. It is hard to keep a remote team on point when they have to use two different project management tools to do their job."
235,235 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Everything we need and then some”,"Overall: Asana keeps just about everything we do organized from a project management standpoint. If it's not in Asana, it's not going to ever get done.",18/12/2019,"Pros: It's extremely powerful, yet flexible at the same time. It doesn't box you into a certain way of doing things, but it has just about every feature you could possibly need at the same time.","Cons: As with any software that's a key piece of operations, there was a substantial learning curve to not only learn the software but figure out how to best use it for our business. But that's not really a knock on Asana, it's just a necessary step to take."
236,236 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Design,2+ years,4,5,5,4,4,9,“Asana: tracking your projects never was so easy”,"Overall: I've been using Asana for 3 years now. It's easy to use, you don't need to explain new collegues how to use it because it's very intuitive. Working with different teams in the same project got better, our communication improved and clients are happier, as results come faster now.",21/8/2019,"Pros: Its user interface is great, is to easy to use! Also, is a nice software to develop projects where many teams need to be involved. Task tracking is good, commenting and sharing files is easy and it has an integration with Everhour.","Cons: Some features need to be added manually, as priority and such. Also, you need to download the app if you want to use the software in your mobile and I don't have more space for dowloading apps in my phone, I prefer logging in my navigator."
237,237 Asana,Asana,Sam M.,Digital Marketing Strategist and Small Business Coach,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,3,,5,7,“Asana - Great Project Management”,"Overall: I really enjoyed using Asana but have since left it for ClickUp which has better functionality around recurring tasks, due dates, and dependencies on their free version.",18/7/2019,"Pros: Asana is a great productivity and project management tool. You can easily create different projects and tasks, assign to specific people and assign due dates. If you use the paid version they also have Gantt chart capabilities.","Cons: While the task assigning is great, there are some limitations around recurring tasks and due dates (you can't set every 2nd tuesday of the month due date for example). They have some great features that are only available on the paid version. The level of usefulness for project management is directly related to whether or not you're on the paid plan."
238,238 Asana,Asana,Aaron M.,COO,Internet,2+ years,5,4,4,,,9,“Great for project management”,"Overall: As mentioned above in out company we use Asana for everyday task tracking for administration, recruitment and retention. It works great along side Google drive or onedrive. We also use Asana to plan out our client project, breaking them down into small tasks and tracking the progress. We can even invite the clients in to be part of the process. Very powerful",22/1/2019,Pros: Asana is easy to use. It is great for a medium to large company and will allow you to create and track tasks for everything for day to day administration to project management. It has more than one way to use the platform giving more possibilities and has some great integrations with slack and gmail. It also has great roles levels meaning you can control who sees which task and group.,Cons: Some times the platform will get slow or stop until refreshed. However this is not a real issue at all. You will not be bothered buy it. Also it not a straight forward platform to use form day one. It will take a couple of weeks to understand the differences between organisations and workspace's etc... But once you do it one of the most powerful tools on the market for task tracking and project management.
239,239 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer & Network Security,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,10,"“Asana, an ideal complement to follow up on your organization's projects.”","Overall: In general terms, Asana is the tool that everyone manages to keep our projects well organized, it is very nice to have on hand a calendar associated with your projects, that you can label people associated or in charge of certain activities and this must be highlighted that you can create secondary tasks and you can even make a copy of them. Asana is already giving something to talk about and this is because they have taken into account the suggestions of their users.",8/1/2019,"Pros: Asana, is very friendly with its structure when it comes to track your projects and work as a team, in addition, to have a point in their favor to work with ""instagantt"" that allows you to make an effective visual planning for your projects. It is a tool that we use daily in the company and even in projects that I carry out as a Freelance with other colleagues, we use ""Asana"" as this allows us to have better organized the procedures of our projects, activities and tasks.","Cons: I feel very happy with the time I have using Asana, you should always innovate, but even the area of work you provide is very comfortable and is something that sometimes these tools tend to have weaknesses."
240,240 Asana,Asana,Lauren A.,Business Manager,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,4,4,4,,5,8,“Good for Small Business”,"Overall: Before Asana, we were using a binder when patients would stop treatment before they were finished - if they were going for an MRI, we'd write that down, and the date they were expecting to get it, and a date when we should follow up. Needless to say, no one ever looked in the binder, most of these MIA patients did not get written down, and the whole system just didn't work. With Asana, we are all on the same page. It's easy to pop a quick task into Asana even if you're in the middle of something else, so there's no reason not to do it. And, now it integrates with our messaging software (Slack), so it's even easier because we can create a task right through there.",19/11/2018,"Pros: For once, we have a space to write tasks down so that we all know what needs to be done, who is responsible, and when it should be done by. The website is relatively easy to use and you can set it up to send emails when something is added or due but not completed. There is a log of what has been done with the task and a place to write notes. You can create different teams, so if you're working on multiple projects with different people, you can have a team for each. You can see tasks assigned to each individual, or view all the tasks.","Cons: Some of my staff can't get the hang of where the ""completed"" button is (even though it's easy for me to see) and end up ""loving"" it instead by clicking the heart (recently changed to a ""like"" with a thumbs up). Which, of course, does not clear the task from the list where it sits until we say ""what is going on, why isn't this completed?"""
241,241 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,11-50 employees,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,6,“Relatively easy to use task-management software.”,,21/6/2018,,"Cons: It's strange that I can never mark a *project* as complete, even if all the tasks within the project have been completed. I would love it if the projects could be converted between boards and lists - right now, when you choose one you're stuck with it, so I wind up having two separate projects: one for my board view and one for my list view. I would also like to be able to choose what information I can see on the board item, or easily complete the task without having to open it up."
242,242 Asana,Asana,moses k.,android app developer,Unspecified,2+ years,4,2,4,2,3,7,“Changed the way we do performance reviews and project management at my place of work”,"Overall: it has greatly project management at a low cost, something we as a small and growing business really appreciate A lot of aggravation that comes with following up on projects has been avoided without much change in internal company structure",20/5/2018,Pros: We were having a major problem tracking who was doing what in our development and marketing teams when Asana came to the rescue. Asana has removed all the inefficiency and aggravation that came with managing fully employed and remote employees. The side panel that allows for ease of creation and editing of tasks is very useful and clutter free. It is very easy to set up tasks and follow up on what is pending and what's completed. The colorful UI also makes Asana a joy to use; its refreshing to see a business software provider that has paid as much attention to the look and feel of the product as they have to actual functionality.,"Cons: There's a lack of a real time chat feature that I would really like to see. A feature where one can chat with an individual and/or the group. As it stands, we have to use third party chat applications to communicate, an annoyance that would be solved if Asana provided this. Asana isn't very intuitive to first time users. While account creation and login is seamless, one is left with the question ""now what?"" after they log in. It would be nicer for Asana to ease the learning curve by providing tool tips or sliders for the most common features"
243,243 Asana,Asana,Matthew Z.,Marketing Systems Manager,201-500 employees,2+ years,4,5,3,3,5,8,“Asana is a great (mostly free) tool for tracking basic team tasks allowing everyone to follow”,"Overall: Good, free team tracking. Great to role out as a trial.",27/3/2018,Pros: The free version of Asana is a great way to see how powerful of a tool it can be for keeping track of personal tasks or ones that require multiple people. You can create detailed tasks (with 'steps' or subtasks) that you can assign to yourself and other members of your team to easily notify them. Reminder email settings can be altered to the level of pestering that you and your team want. Linking to Google docs is also easy to keep track of where content is being created.,"Cons: Asana has some frustrating limitations. Including people on only certain parts of a task, making sure that people are not overwhelmed by details they don't need to be part of and attaching working files can be painful to the point that if basic guidelines are not adhered to, your team may feel exhausted by the software and just stop using it. The trick to Asana is to constantly groom your tasks and update due dates so that you are not bombarded with notifications that things are due on all on the same Friday afternoon. It is intuitive, but it will not plan for you."
244,244 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,4,5,3,4,,,"“Nice and simple UI, ideal for not too complex projects, very easy to use, very fast and responsive”",,21/3/2018,,"Cons: It definitely is not suitable for bigger marketing agencies, although they claim that this is one of their target customers. Why? There is no way to create customers in Asana, add finished tasks to invoices or something like this. The only workaround is the excessive use of custom fields and reports which really isn't all that intuitive. Oh and there is no GANTT view available so it's almost impossible to create a meaningful bird's eye view of a project with dozens or even hundreds of tasks."
245,245 Asana,Asana,Danny E.,CEO,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,10,“Great for non-tech project management for start-ups”,Overall: I highly recommend any start-up start with project management by using Asana. It will get you going and allow you to quickly understand how your team functions.,17/2/2018,Pros: Asana is incredibly easy to set up and use. It is a great tool for non-tech team. I would highly recommend an AGILE based software for tech teams that integrates with Asana. Our team has found it best to keep the business tasks in Asana and the tech tasks elsewhere. Asana is very popular so it is usually easy to connect it to other software. It is very easy to create separate projects with sections and tasks and infinitely many subtasks. The ability to have subtasks and dependencies makes Asana one of the best project management systems out there for me.,"Cons: Asana recently added a board view, similar to Trello. I love it, but wish you could switch between it and a list view. They haven't done this yet. I also don't like how tasks aren't tied to the sections they are in. If you check off a section, it takes all the tasks below it and puts them in the section above. This can get really confusing if you accidentally mark off a section."
246,246 Asana,Asana,Saphryn S.,Interaction Designer,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,,,,,,“Asana vs. Producteev”,"Overall: Asana and Producteev have been at each other's throats for the last few years now, but some of the key features that make a task management app excel remain in Asana territory. Here's why: WHAT BOTH APPS DO - Integrate with Sunrise (the only calendar app out there that makes you go, ""finally, a calendar done right""). - Apply a top-to-bottom information architecture to the concept of productivity that goes as follows: - Workspace (Asana) or Network (Producteev) - think of these as departments or teams. - Projects - this is essentially a bundle of tasks. - Tasks - Subtasks - ie. the task ""clean bedroom"" might have subtasks ""fold clothes"" and ""vacuum floor"". - Allow conversations within tasks. Here, you can add comments, links to web documents, etc. WHAT ONLY ASANA DOES - Assign people, not only to projects and tasks, but to subtasks as well. In other words, with Asana, the task ""clean bedroom"" can be broken down by assigning subtasks - Stan to ""fold clothes"", Kyle to ""file papers"", Eric to ""clean bathroom"", and Kenny to ""vacuum floor"". In Producteev, subtasks cannot be assigned. You can only assign the entire task to, which makes it hard to identify who's doing what. - Create a task description. Just like with Facebook newsfeeds, people's comments and notes can get lost in the mix when working on a project with 4 or more people. Stan - ""Where's the link to the Google Doc?"" Kyle - ""I sent it to you."" Stan - ""When?"" Kyle - ""Scroll up the comments to like 2 days ago."" Stan - ""Oh, there it is thanks."" Sometimes you just need a fixed (not streaming) space to put relevant information that you don't want floating away down the river. Calendar links, Document links, Google Maps links this is the perfect place for those. SUMMARY - All in all, I believe Asana definitely wins in the task management game by just a few features, but those features just so happen to be the ones that count.",25/8/2014,"Pros: - Enables you to assign people to tasks AND subtasks (Producteev does not) - Enables you to make notes and comments, all in a conversational view. - Provides a task description pane for your static information (Producteev does not).","Cons: - It used to allow you to invite 30 members per workspace for free. Now it allows for 15 invitations. - There is no Mac App for Asana (although it works smoothly in Chrome, Safari, Mozilla, Opera, and IE)."
247,247 Asana,Asana,Leighton F.,CEO,Sports,2+ years,5,5,4,,,10,“Excellent Project Management Tool”,Overall: Excellent. Asana has been an invaluable tool for me managing my business and participating in others.,3/8/2020,"Pros: Makes project collaboration much easier. Easy to learn, and a healthy amount of features even in the free tier.",Cons: Doesn't seem to have a robust team calendar (or much of any team calendar where events don't have to be tied to tasks).

249,249 Asana,Asana,Michael B.,Operations Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,4,4,4,7,“It worked for us while we used it”,"Overall: We used Asana to manage our business process workflows. I envisioned using it to document and navigate all of our repeatable business processes, but in the end it just wasn't tenable. We ended up moving to TeamworkIQ and it has done a much better job of fitting our needs. Much simpler approach while still maintaining powerful features. However, I also need to add that we are using the paid version of TeamworkIQ, so maybe we could have made things work with Asana if we had moved to the paid version of Asana.",17/3/2020,"Pros: Initially I did like this software quite a bit. I spent a good amount of time trying to set it up to work in a way that would be complimentary to our business processes. However, in the end we decided to move to a different platform that worked better for the way we do business.","Cons: There were some aspects of the software that were frustrating and created obstacles to gaining end-user buy-in. It's been a while now since I've used it, but in general I can say that as we continued using it, it became more and more cumbersome and impractical to continue using it. This may be because we were using the free version and we were working to create workarounds for the handicapped functionality that came with the free version."

It has help me to keep track of my every ongoing project. It's easy to use and set up, adding a workspace into the project and planning has been so efficient with Asana. It also provides nice graphs, statistics, and reports, which in terms keeping an eye on progress is quite easy.",19/2/2020,"Pros: Asana is a cloud-based project and task management software which is built for multiple platforms like Web, Mac, IOS and android. It enables companies and ad agencies to manage and organize tasks and projects. Asana is equipped with variant functionality and meets all kinds of organizational and communication needs. It allows users to keep ongoing conversations and document links within specific project. It helps in performing collaborative activities quickly and efficiently.","Cons: The free version is so limiting that users could use only lists, boards and calender view option and add up few members in the project team. Untill you buy a premuim plan there's no any way to proceed with a large team members. However it's kind of satisfying for non-premuim users having few members in their project, they can still enroll and do the jobs. Also, the timeline advanced search and workflow rules are only available for premium users."

I would love it if our entire organization could use it, but instead, we can only afford to have two departments use this product. Would it be possible to have a reader view so that people without seats can take a look at the calendar and task lists?"
252,252 Asana,Asana,Nathan W.,Marketing Director,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,4,3,4,,4,7,"“Great for some things, not great for others”",Overall: Great software if used right. Has tons of functionality and can be what you need. Just don't let it micromanage you or your team.,12/12/2019,"Pros: With tons of tasks to do everyday, involving lots of people, Asana can be a lifesaver for keeping track of and managing all the projects your company is doing. I keep track of many of the personal tasks I need to do in Asana, but also love being able to quickly assign tasks and projects to my team. It's also great to be able to track on the conversations connected to each particular task, helping better organize the project evolution and keeping that specific ""noise"" away from other projects and out of the email inbox.","Cons: Asana is like fire. It can keep your house warm, or burn it down. If you're not careful, depending on who is using it (and how Asana is being used), it can turn into a micromanager's weapon of choice and a living hell for employees. Who wants a hundred new messages in their email inbox letting them know they have new tasks assigned to them, with little context or explanation? Another example: ""You want me to call that one client back? Please don't put that in Asana. Just tell me, please. I'm two doors down from you."" Tread carefully young Asana Padawans."

I'm able to clear my mind by using Asana and get great relief knowing all my tasks are in one place and organized,3/12/2019,"Pros: I love how I can set tasks to repeat, move them to different days, users, etc. I could not organize my days without Asana. I organize four different companies with Asana and can color code my projects, leave comments for my tasks, or have conversations with my other team members.","Cons: I have nothing bad to say, I love Asana"
254,254 Asana,Asana,Jason R.,Sr. Graphic Designer,Design,2+ years,5,4,5,,,10,“I Recommended This Product at My Place of Employment”,"Overall: I've used Asana for years. We used it for tracking all of our projects. It's so much easier than tracking jobs through email. Everything about a certain project is in one place so it's super easy. Even tracking revisions of designs is easy because each project and hold multiple design proofs. When I started my new job, they were asking about a project tracking software. I strongly recommended Asana because of its ease of use and that is what we use currently. I couldn't be happier.",29/10/2019,Pros: It's easy to use (at least as a user). It makes it super easy to track projects and using it for design is great because you can post jpgs of artwork for approval. Also there is a free version,Cons: Some of the admin stuff confuses me but I've never technically been an admin for it. Someone else always has so when I try to set up jobs I do it wrong. I'm sure it's just my ignorance though and not the software itself.

I use the software to track my own projects and those of my team as well as help others the set up and track their teams and projects.",17/10/2019,Pros: Asana is able to organize and handle projects and teams of any size and scope. There is no limit to the way a project can be broken down. Other benefits are the notifications and task tracking settings. Keep your team working on time without being overly micromanaging. It gives team members just enough autonomy to work independently but still keep leaders and stake holders informed of progress.,"Cons: Asana isn't immediately easy to use. It's not as intuitive as some other simpler to use programs but the increased over all functionality is worth the learning curve. That said, it's not so hard to use that with just some training any team member can use it efficiently."
256,256 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“I love Asana!”,"Overall: I had a great experience with Asana. It is easy to use and create boards, tasks, teams, etc. It is perfect for any size business looking for an easy project management solution. It also works great as a editorial calendar for content.",15/10/2019,"Pros: I love Asana! It's easy to organize projects and create boards. I love the global search feature so you can find pretty much anything really fast. Also, the ability to set tasks for yourself and not have to tie them to a project or anything is helpful.",Cons: Nothing really is bad about it. Overall the software met and exceeded all of my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone.

Whoever worked on the user interface did a GREAT job. Plus, the connection with Slack is awesome",Cons: The learning curve to learn how to fully use it is the most difficult part.
259,259 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Internet,2+ years,4,5,4,,,8,"“Intuitive, though maybe not as powerful. ”",,29/7/2019,,"Cons: While Asana is intuitive, it isn't necessarily as powerful as competitors in the task management space. For example, there's really no ability to make tasks go through complex workflows, and you have to make use of workarounds like tags (ex. creating a tag for ""to-do"") or kanban board columns to represent status."
260,260 Asana,Asana,Adam M.,Production Director,Entertainment,2+ years,5,5,3,,5,9,“Daily Companion for my Work Week”,,26/6/2019,,"Cons: The pricing structure is prohibitive for small teams needing just a portion of the premium features.

262,262 Asana,Asana,Rob C.,Marketing Copywriter,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Efficiency and organization made beautiful”,"Overall: As someone who gets frustrated with poor UI and UX, Asana is the only project management solution I've worked with that I genuinely like using. I genuinely get pleasure out of carefully maintaining the arrangements of tasks and projects I am working on, creating colour-coded status tags and all the rest. Oh, and the fact that cute creatures fly across the screen when tasks are completed brings joy every time. Heartily recommend this software.",26/5/2019,"Pros: I strongly believe that for project management software to be effective, you have to like using it. I love using Asana. It offers the flexibility to lay your work out how you like, whether in a task list or a kanban setup, with a little work making it possible to break projects down by department, team, and project as necessary. Task tracking is a breeze, file sharing is a breeze, commenting on progress is a breeze - just about any function you might need to do over the course of contributing to or monitoring a project is dead simple with Asana. Best of all, Asana is beautiful. In my opinion, it's far less prone to clutter than some of the other popular project management tools, and it just looks more modern and usable. It makes being organized a pleasure.","Cons: Genuinely, I have no complaints about this software. The free version is a great start, and the Premium level offers some killer utility (timeline, task dependencies, etc.) at a reasonable price for those teams that need them."
263,263 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Streamlined work communication”,"Overall: We got into Asana because internal work communication was taking over our email boxes. But it has done so much more for us! We are constantly singing its praises--we joke that we could do a free ad for Asana, but we honestly love giving them the free advertising because the free software is so comprehensive (for our small team, at least). It has a clean interface, has just enough personality, and the improvements are always for a specific reason, not just to change things.",30/1/2019,"Pros: Being able to communicate with other team members in one place has been invaluable. We love being able to look back on the history of a project, and our overextended nonprofit staff of 4 is able to check in on what other people are doing without having to bug them. One team member loves being able to assign each other tasks, another team member loves that all our communicaiton is aken off email, and I love using the boards to organize a project.","Cons: This sounds weird, but it has made us so much more efficent, it's given us an inflated sense of how much we can get done. In other words, we sometimes put too much on our plates. This leads us to saying, ""I'm in the red,"" which means we have a lot of overdue tasks. This basically means the software is crazy good. And it shows how deeply immersed into Asana we are."
264,264 Asana,Asana,Adam R.,Logistics Manager,Biotechnology,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,8,“Project Management”,"Overall: It is a multi-faceted solution for many projects or tasks. I love the reminder system they have in place that emails any changes or tasks directly to those accountable or involved.

As I mentioned, I also use Asana to manage our weekly, quarterly and annual executive meetings with ease.",24/1/2019,"Pros: I love the layout in card view for managing my projects. It allows for a ""Post-It"" note style layout which has allowed me to move away from having a ton of physical Post-It notes all over my desk. It also has provided the structure necessary to support efficient meetings. I facilitate our Upper Management meetings once a week and I could not do it without Asana","Cons: One aspect I have some issues with is that all projects are visible by those who are using the app. Other teams can look at and through my team's projects and details. Not a big deal, and I am sure there are protections in there somewhere to request access to certain projects but I am not sure. For example, we hold executive manager meetings using Asana, but anyone from my Operations Team can look through our meeting info where we have potentially sensitive material or information."
265,265 Asana,Asana,Quin S.,Customer Success Manager,Education Management,2+ years,5,4,4,,,9,"“Efficient, intuitive and enjoyable”","Overall: I use Asana (the free version) to manage a multimedia project (podcast), collaborating with a team of several people. All of us love it, and it allows us to literally keep on the same page, with right up-to-the-second updates. It seriously is like Asana was written for our needs. We love it.",1/10/2018,"Pros: Asana is brilliant. It provides plenty of flexibility for organizing your work, and managing it with others. The interface is pleasant and stable. The hierarchy of objects makes sense, and once you figure-out the workflow, managing tasks is a breeze. Interacting with others is simple ... You can assign ownership of tasks to individuals, or only add them as followers so they get notifications about what's going on. Due dates keep you on track, file attachments lets you add supplementary resources. Plus, changes are updated live for everyone, so there is no lag time between team members. The mobile app is smartly designed, allowing you to do just about anything you would do through the Web.","Cons: The interface comes with a bit of a learning curve, but nothing too severe. Some actions (i.e. switching between projects) can be a little tricky to find. But with regular use, navigating around Asana is fast and makes sense for the most part."
266,266 Asana,Asana,Ricardo S.,Structural Engineer,Civil Engineering,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“A very functional way to manage a project”,"Overall: I received a very handy and user-friendly way to manage my projects. I can keep track on the tasks I assign to my team members, and keep in touch with them through it. Which allows me to safe time and make better decisions regarding the project tasks.",30/7/2018,"Pros: It has an intuitive and user-firendly interface with many features to make a proper project management, such as: - Project tracking: It has a dashboard that shows how the projects assigned to your team members are being developed. So you can track and look which project requires more attention. - Privacy: You can also show the info of your project to the people you want. - Admin assignment: It is crucial for projects that require many teams to be involved. So you can assign the admin privilege to one person of your organization, so he can manage other team members. - It has a great team with an easy way to cantact them to ask questions. This program has been a great help to keep track on my projects, and it is extremely easy to learn how to use it, anyway, they have many videos on their website available anytime for users to learn the features of this program.","Cons: It is hard for me to find any cons with this software, since I'm completely satisfied with it. However, the only con I would say it has, it is that it requires a premium account to access the most useful features. But, I can surely say it is totally worth the invesment."

While other competitors do offer some board-based project management, Asana does it but I think it still needs some polishing."
268,268 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,3,4,4,8,"“Asana is a great task management tool, and is turning into a good Project Management tool.”","Overall: The biggest benefit I get is the ability to quickly add and display my tasks for the immediate future, and prioritize them as needed. Asana is a really great tool for tracking to-do lists for a small team or as a meeting action item list.",4/12/2017,"Pros: I use Asana to prioritize my tasks for the day, week, month. I can quickly create tasks and add due dates or assign them to someone else. It's very easy to update multiple tasks at a time. I've never found a tool that was faster at adding information and intuitively sorting it. Copy / Paste from a spreadsheet works fantastic, so when we need to import tasks from an estimate it takes hardly any time.","Cons: There are a couple of downsides to Asana. You cannot move a label and take all of the tasks that live under the label with it. As such, it can be easy to disrupt large projects by having tasks moved to the wrong spot. Also, Asana will not be a true Project Management tool until a user can track time against tasks, or add proper estimates. There is a workaround for estimation, but it is clunky and cannot be measured against. Analytics are also a little lacking."
269,269 Asana,Asana,Chetan C.,,Higher Education,2+ years,4,4,4,,5,8,“Great Tool for Basic Project Management”,"Overall: I work at a University and we have a lot of student who work at our center. I was having trouble making sure they always knew what they should be working on, especially if I wasn't around when they were scheduled to work. Asana provided a really nice way for me to assign our students tasks and it allows me to continue to look at our queue of work to see what has been completed and what still needs to be done. It has also helped me get rid of my google drive ""to do"" list, and organize my projects (with deadlines I set) in a way that's easier to view and keep track of. Since I started using it last year, they've rolled out some new features, so they are slowly allowing for more complex project management. It does take a little bit of time to familiarize yourself with all of the functions they do have. For example, there's some quirky settings to determine which projects are public to everyone who's part of your workspace and which projects are private to just you and the person you assigned a task to. I still don't think I'm taking advantage of everything it has to offer. However, even getting the basics down has helped me and my colleagues become more efficient at managing the process of assigning projects to our students (After I started using it, I told my colleagues about it and most of us are now using it). It has provided more clarity to our students as well about what they should be working on. We're using the free version, which allows for having up to 15 people in your workspace, so it's definitely worth every penny we paid :)",3/11/2016,,
270,270 Asana,Asana,David W.,Project Manager / Owner,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Best kept secret for collaboration”,"Overall: We use ASANA for every customer. We use it to store all communication and documents, and in most cases we invite the customer in to participate in the collaboration effort. The software is so easy the customers can't help but get involved! Some have since gone off and bought their own copy of the software for their business because they liked it so much. Thank you guys for making our projects run so much smoother",3/11/2016,Pros: Love the interface - love the way it works.,"Cons: The software is configured to have all clients under one umbrella - which does not work for us. We would prefer to spin up ""mini"" accounts (In ASANA they are called Work spaces). While we have one or two major accounts where we mix and mingle our teams and accounts. we also like to do one off Work spaces, for big projects. A lot of new users to the software accidentally complete a task and think it is gone forever, or they complete a task and forget what the task was. We find we spend a lot of time searching for tasks that were completed by accident."
271,271 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Internet,2+ years,4,4,,4,,,"“Fantastic, non-visual project/task manager”","Overall: We started using Asana when we had just a handful of employees and clients. We needed something easy-to-use, but powerful, since we were using it as both a client support portal (think alternative to Zendesk or Basecamp), but also for our project and task management software. Clients submitted bugs and requests. We prioritized and assigned to developers.",10/12/2015,"Pros: What I described above sounds like every project management software tool out there. Where Asana really shines is in the communication. We literally replaced email with this tool-both between clients and our internal account managers, and between our account managers and other internal team members, such as developers. Commenting and conversation around each task or sub-task was easy, intuitive, and centralized. The ability to easily categorize using tags and creating sections allowed our process and flow to change several times while the system didn't break a sweat. The pricing is fantastic compared to many systems and, once you get acquainted with the interface, the system is so flexible that you'll find yourself using it for things you may not have intended. We have used it for weekly meeting agenda managment, for a CRM, for a wiki-replacement, and of course for personal task management.","Cons: The reason we ultimately ended up adding another project management tool to our toolset (Targetprocess), is that our developers needed a visual task board that could span several projects, not just a higher level story board. While we could achieve this using tags, it wasn't what the software was built for. It's less visual nature (I'm referring to kanban board like software, such as Trello or Targetprocess)."
272,272 Asana,Asana,Julie S.,Registered Acupuncturist and Founder,Alternative Medicine,2+ years,5,4,5,,5,10,“Asana is by far the most used software by my company”,"Overall: I would recommend every company use Asana, no matter what your company is. If you want something to help keep yourself and employees on track, clear with what their tasks are, and saves time by not having to email back and forth, this is 100% where Asana will excel.",18/10/2020,"Pros: Asana was first introduced to me from my business coach. We started off with a fairly simple list. As my company moved forward and I introduced new facets to it, Asana kept me on track and focused with what I needed to accomplish. I like that it syncs with google calendar, has reminders, and you can work with colleagues in one space to collaborate. I like that you can have subcategories, leave notes, and move categories around. For my writing, I now have a seperate project, and use the board feature. Now I can see my blog posts at every stage of the process. It's easy to tidy your spaces up so things aren't cluttered, like they would be if I just kept them in my brain, lol.","Cons: I am not afraid to complain about a softward, but I honestly cannot fault Asana at all."
273,273 Asana,Asana,Jens G.,digital marketing specialist,Building Materials,2+ years,4,4,4,5,4,8,“Asana perfect fit”,Overall: Easy to use and flows are one big plus. I would surely recommend to use it for projectmanagement purposes.,29/9/2020,"Pros: Ease of use, intuitive and feature rich. When your on a project and need to collaborate or track tasks, this tool is excellent. Also the flows are a big plus.",Cons: Structure of the details of a task could be more like Basecamp. Also when you have a lot of projects it tends to get a bit messy.
274,274 Asana,Asana,Dana G.,Account Director,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“Perfect for large teams or complex projects”,Overall: Asana solved team collaboration for us as a team that quickly expanded to offices and employees across multiple office locations. It has scaled as we have grown our client base and continues to help keep us organized and meet deadlines.,4/8/2020,Pros: This product is easy to use and integrate across different teams. There are many setting to help notify you on progress of a project and the mobile app works flawlessly as well.,Cons: There is a short learning period with this product for more complex projects. Definitely spend some time exploring different layouts and capabilities ahead of developing a larger project.
275,275 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,International Trade and Development,2+ years,5,5,5,4,,10,“Excellent project management tool”,"Overall: Using Asana helps me keep the overview of my projects and to focus on the goals in hand, rather than being distracted with an overly long to-do list: I only see tasks when they are to be done & not for months beforehand",6/5/2020,Pros: I love the fact that Asana is so simple to use: - I can boomerang tasks - I can work out of Asana instead of my inbox - I have all the relevant project information in one place - I can make imports from other programmes (eg project templates) and also export or integrate with a wide range of tools - excellent training materials,"Cons: I would like to have the possibility to show all of my tasks in one list. I'm in a couple of workspaces (one personal and one for the company) and if I forward mails to Asana from my company mail address they automatically go to my personal workspace. It feels clunky to switch between the two and I risk missing something Unfortunately, I can't integrate Asana with my Outlook as I don't work with the Office 365 subscription version but a purchased version installed on my laptop"
276,276 Asana,Asana,Jeheen Mahmood Z.,Senior Data Analyst,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“The best project management app ever.”,"Overall: I am a mid-level manager in my team. I have been setting up tasks for my subordinates since day one. Similarly, I use it to report the task status to my superiors and get inputs from them. We now use nearly 0 emails, saves a lot of time.",5/12/2019,"Pros: I love the intuitive way the tasks are setup. I have on boarded employees with 0 knowledge and they hit the ground running. Setting deadlines, subtasks, comments everything comes automatically to you. Its true that Asana is deploying more features regularly and some of the higher functions I do not use nor know of. But the core functions needed to run a multi-department project is a breeze. To top it off, most people would only need a free tier account, we started with that ourselves.","Cons: No big cons comes to mind, I am a fan. But to dive deeper, the mobile app is a little too crowded. And more native features would be great. Right now we have to bring in other app integrations for several functions."

I like the ability to easily make notes and upload attachments to the tasks.","Cons: There is a bit of a messy feel to it. When you are in a task or subtask, it's not visually apparent where you are at within a project. I think some more visual representations (boxes within boxes, flow charts, etc.) would help. The new layout helps a bit, as does the ""board"" layout. Also, one thing that would be good would be able to see the project as a whole and see ALL the attachments associated with that project at once."
278,278 Asana,Asana,Quratulain H.,Project Head,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,4,,4,8,“Simplifying Task Managment”,Overall: I use it primarily in projects where client feedback is important. This tool makes UAT a breeze,7/10/2019,"Pros: Asana takes a minimalist approach to project and task management. If you're looking to keep track of what is due, who is responsible for what and to keep everything traceable yet together, look no further than Asana. The tool makes task and resource management a breeze and it is extremely user friendly. This is highly recommended for teams where some of the users don't like to use software and/or find new tools difficult to use","Cons: I've used only the free versions and in that there is no way to curtail the number of emails the tool generates. Sometimes, the emails sent via mobile phone bounce back which also negates the expereince and ease. It doesn't have core Project Management, so it cannot be used as a PM tool on its own"
279,279 Asana,Asana,Rebecca O.,Dir of Digital Marketing,Education Management,2+ years,4,3,3,2,5,6,“Task Management”,Overall: I continue to use it as it keeps my team organized.,26/9/2019,"Pros: The task management and comment sections that allow for quick and efficient edits. Also, the ability to email tasks directly into the software.","Cons: Aesthetically, it's a bit clunky. It would be great to have better boards, templates, calendar features. It takes a long time to get truly adept at using it. I do wish there were folders under Projects to help organize. Often time my tasks within projects can get very long."
280,280 Asana,Asana,Rod M.,Project Manager,Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Easy to use and saves me time”,Overall: Really easy to use. I have tried other software but always come back to Asana.,6/9/2019,Pros: Asana is super easy to use! Asana helped us organize our internal processes while providing us with tools to track and execute all our projects on time. We tried a few other software but always came back to Asana since it's the most complete software with a very competitive pricing structure.,"Cons: Not any that I can think off. Once in a blue moon, there are delays in the system but they get fixed asap and you can track the ""health status"" of the system on the website. It's super useful."
281,281 Asana,Asana,Sophia T.,Software Development Engineer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Stay organized both personally and professionally.”,"Overall: My experience with Asana has been quite positive, although at the beginning it was difficult for me to adapt to the large number of functions that it offers, soon I learned to use them efficiently, now with the workspaces, I can better organize my time, and take Carry out personal and professional projects with coworkers in a more organized and efficient way.",28/8/2019,"Pros: It is my ideal tool when organizing my tasks, projects, etc. What I like most about Asana is that allows me to create workspaces, and always keeps me up to date with new notifications, it is also quite useful for teamwork since it has many functions that allow me to track the tasks of each member of the team, has counters, notifications, assignments of tasks to each participant of the group, also allows me to divide large tasks, into subtasks which allows to divide large tasks into smaller ones and to be assigned more specifically, one or more members .","Cons: It is not something negative, but if one aspect to consider, is that asanas can be something complex to use at the beginning due to the large number of functions offered."

Asana offers a lot of organization and flexibility.",24/8/2019,"Pros: It's great to be able to set up multiple projects and assign tasks to different people. We use Asana to track everything from big, long term projects, to small day to day tasks that would otherwise get lost in the minutia. Custom fields are super convenient","Cons: We were only interested in one or two of the paid features (eg creating timelines) but couldn't select those separately. However, even for a small startup, the expense isn't too much of a burden."
283,283 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Higher Education,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“Must-have project management tool for teams of all sizes”,Overall: Having a centralized system where everybody on the team is aware of what projects are ongoing. This tool has also helped us fill gaps that existed in account services.,29/5/2019,"Pros: The platform is incredibly dynamic and serves as our go-to platform for all aspects of project management, including establishing timelines and roles and responsibilities. Overall the platform has helped my team communicate more efficiently and manage projects in a centralized way.","Cons: Over time, it can get cluttered with projects. Maintenance is a must."
284,284 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,5,,5,10,“Great project management tool!”,"Overall: Asana looks great and feels great. It has a clean design yet allows for some fun elements like the unicorns popping up when you mark a task complete. Without Asana, I wouldn't be half as organized and productive.",22/5/2019,"Pros: Asana is one of my most important tools at work, if not *the* most important. What looks like a digital to-do list at first, proves to be a lot more powerful than just that. It helps me keep an overview of what I'm working on as well as what others in my team are currently working on. It increases transparency and context, while still allowing to keep access to certain projects (e.g. HR topics) limited to only a group of people.","Cons: I like the inbox, however, I feel that things can get messy when you have a lot of tasks and there's a lot being discussed in them. So unless you're not constantly checking your Asana inbox, it's happened to us before that information got lost. Also, the sorting options for tasks could be made a bit clearer. I'm an avid Asana user so I know how to use the ""none"" mode for tasks, for example, but it's not exactly intuitive."
285,285 Asana,Asana,Liberty P.,_____,Broadcast Media,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,"“Free ""basic"" option already packs a punch!”","Overall: We didn't have a project management solution outside of email before Asana, and it has really helped our team get organized and move away from excuses like ""I didn't see that email.""",27/12/2018,"Pros: Our team uses the basic option, which already delivers much of what small teams need for project management software: organizing projects (we do this using ""teams""), assigning due dates, status updates, and a calendar view. We haven't found a need for any of the premium features, which seem to be more appropriate for larger organizations, but we're pleased at how robust Asana's basic option already is! As one for aesthetics, I appreciate the clean design that Asana brings to the table. Because of the clean design, the site loads fast, which is always a plus. Project management solutions can easily get overwhelming, but Asana's approach is the cleanest I've seen so far. The ability to attach media and document files to each task item has been useful for our multimedia team, as has the ability to break each task into sub-tasks -- again, something that could easily get overwhelming, but thanks to good design, isn't a big issue with Asana.","Cons: Email notifications can get overwhelming, but I've turned this off in my settings. There's an Inbox dashboard, which is more like a news feed, if you ever need to check on what's been updated."
286,286 Asana,Asana,Dave S.,Owner,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,3,4,4,2,5,"“Asana - Good at everything, Great at nothing”","Overall: Asana was our project management platform for nearly 3 years. The platform is well developed, well supported, offers an extensive line of integrations, has a robust Zapier integration available, and is a forward thinking software. One of the greatest perks of Asana is also one of the greatest downfalls - it is not customized for one particular industry. You can make it your own no matter what industry you're a part of - however, if you're looking for industry specific tools and functionality, Asana will not have them. This software thrives on being a generalist software and meets everyones needs about half way - but does so in an attractive and feature-centric way. You can expect regular product enhancements, new features, and attractive interface. You can also expect many of the newest and most helpful features to be limited to paid only plans - understandable. However, their paid only plans are pricy and for being a non-industry specific platform, they cost is often unreasonable.",3/12/2018,"Pros: It is clean, well developed, and is fairly flexible","Cons: Their pricing plans continue to escalated in cost rapidly and they force you into a minimum number of user tier. So if you need 6 seats, they force you to buy 10 - nearly doubling the cost per user."

Every project is managed using this tool, and since we use it to manage our daily workflow, it is effortless to follow up on Ongoing Projects and communicate the progress each stakeholder is making. Asana is adding value to the business, for sure",15/11/2018,"Pros: Asana is a fantastic Task Organizer and it is definitely fit for everyone! Whether you have a 5000+ employee company or you work as a freelancer, Asana is the tool for you! It allows you to organize your tasks, prioritize them, follow up on their progress and more! Also, it's Project Management features are not only professional grade, but very easy to use. Not everyone knows how to use PM Softwares and Asana makes Gantt Charts, Communication between groups and Task Precedences as easy as you would like them to be! Amazing tool, very helpful!

288,288 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,8,“Team management gets fun”,Overall: Definitely recommended for teams of all sizes.,7/11/2018,"Pros: Asana is extremely easy to use especially when compared to other project management apps like Trello. You can get started with Asana almost immediately while on Trello, you'd need some time to understand features. Asana's user interface is more current and advanced. I love it. It is just like you are using a text messaging app or email. Works great. Assigning projects, creating tasks, and tracking project progress is a piece of cake with Asana. The gantt chart feature is another plus. You can use Asana for free with limited features which makes it a perfect tool for small businesses with small teams.","Cons: 1. Assigning tasks to multiple people is clearly one thing where Asana needs to work. 2. The technical foundation of the tool needs to be approved. One common issue that my team faces is that when a document or a file is dragged for uploading in Asana, it doesn't work in the first go. Not sure if it is a technical issue time-based issue or permanent."

For a given task, you can easily drag/drop files into the task, create sub-tasks, or add tasks to provide better details about the task at hand. It is easy to add comments to the task and provide a conversation flow when there are questions or other items to clarity. Using tagging and e-mail responses your customers can easily engage with your team. Asana has a standard ""list"" style for each project, but now has Kanban style projects as well, which helps increase visibility on workflow even more.","Cons: I don't have any major complaints about Asana. The only limitation it has is that it isn't geared towards an Agile/SCRUM type project since there are no sprints, points, or anything in that regard. However, this isn't really an issue for small/medium sized projects and would get in the way of users if it was."
290,290 Asana,Asana,John B.,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,"“Asana, making the world more productive!”","Overall: Active Asana user since February 2013 where its ease of use and ability to quickly get up and running while always improving make it our team tracking app of choice. Some pros: * Ability to search your tasks by section. * Using Harvest to track time is great, but it is nice to have this now built into Asana natively. * Ability to have nested subtask to as many as five levels with no problems as of yet, although they are not as easily readable since the subtasks are not indented below their specific task or subtask except when printed. * Great to be able to highlight and pin important comments. * Just love the merge duplicate tasks feature which sometimes still has to be done manually. * The power of being able to have the same tasks in multiple projects through linking is a great time saver. * The new Asana blog design is great as a primer for designing your own website. * The integration of Asana with TimeCamp is awesome. * The ability to see all the tasks you've created, followed, or assigned is helpful. Some cons: * Email tasks are not in HTML rich text so the links are parsed out. * Tasks started as separate are sometimes hard to find and group under a main tasks later on. * Ability to be able to select multiple tasks and drag them all over at one time under a new task. * The ability to move projects between workspaces. * Personal Projects workspace is too limiting compared to household and work. * Searching for a task or tasks is sometimes difficult to find especially for similar tasks and subtasks. * Many search results are displayed unlike more accurate searching available in Gmail using their advanced operators. * Sections are great, but for single tasks it would be nice if we could set it as complete and not have it disappear from view. * Logging off and on everyday alleviated most speed problems, but sometimes minor performance speed problems still persists. * Would be great to have all of my tasks show up in one place, regardless of what workspace they reside in. * Asana web task clipper (Asana Extension for Google Chrome) works great, but it would be nice if there was a way to be able to add the web clipped task to a particular project, task, etc. Asana absolutely Rocks big time and is such an integral part of my day along with a handful of other go-to apps that I use on a minute-by-minute basis with the added bonus of Asana being free for teams up to 15 members.",11/11/2016,,

It has provided me much ease through its mobile application which keeps me connected and tuned all the time, now traveling does not affect my work speed.",24/9/2020,Pros: Asana is the most advanced project management tool that has helped me to grow along with my team members as it has provided me an opportunity to stay connected and to take more important steps towards the project execution. Through this tool I am capable of making effective business plans on the basis of the reports that Asana provides me. It is very simplest and easy to use software and its interface is very appealing too.,"Cons: There are so many repetitive sessions which need to be automated for the more work ease. Also it is limited in terms of integrations as it is collaborated with few types of software, and this hinders the attachment of particular document types, when you need to share it with your team members."
294,294 Asana,Asana,Bob L.,Director of Business Operations,Financial Services,2+ years,5,4,4,,,8,“Asana for Project Management”,Overall:,31/8/2020,"Pros: Asana has been important for our organization as we adopt a new CRM. Users can be easily added to the team and tasks can be assigned quickly. Additionally, email notifications go out immediately when something is assigned. Update and reminder emails can also be triggered at daily & weekly intervals, which is very helpful when trying to juggle myriad other tasks at work. I'm a list person, so this definitely helps me visualize what needs to be done and who is doing it.","Cons: For some users who are less tech-savvy, the initial navigation within the tool is difficult. It's easy to ""click around"" and close out tasks without intending to do so. While not a showstopper, there is definitely an implementation period for new users to get used to navigation and functionality."
295,295 Asana,Asana,Maria Rosario T.,Outreach Specialist,Health,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,10,“Great improvements!”,"Overall: If your a new user, you will get confused. It will take time to get use to it and learn it's functions but as you go along you'll learn to appreciate it. But I love the fact that they always update this app. When we started to use it the interface was a bit intimidating, now it has evolve to looking engaging and catchy it even has the option to set the color & icon.",28/8/2020,Pros: The recent update with it's interface made it easy to track progress on Projects we are working on. You can easily see which one to prioritize and which is left behind. Creating subtasks on a task is quite useful especially if there's information from the main task that we don't feel confident to share on another user. Having a place to review my tasks makes it efficient for me to meet my deadlines as I can prioritize which needs immediate attention.,Cons: Each time I share a screenshot on the comments of a task the screenshot does not stay on the thread which sometimes confuse the person you're sharing it too most especially if this person is too lazy to read all the comments.

I likewise value the possibility to coordinate with different stages. Very adaptable, it's the least difficult framework with the kanban model. it's phenomenal for consecutive work. I'm an extremely visual individual. I appreciate being able to mastermind my sheets in a manner that makes sense to me.",16/6/2020,"Pros: I like how you'll keep venture materials together and include connections, and so forth I truly like the element that you essentially can utilize it on your cell and on the web both. I truly like the ability to pick foundation photographs. it's entirely adaptable and that I can alter it to what I might want. I additionally appreciate the very reality that I'm not bound to utilizing this on a work area/PC yet I can utilize the portable application too.",Cons: I was trusting that it may have a type of time-following abilities. it is likewise disillusioning that I can not charge my customer utilizing the stage since it would make huge amounts of things smoother.
299,299 Asana,Asana,Ruth P.,CEO and Founder,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“THE best project management tool out there for marketing teams”,"Overall: Honestly, if you're a small marketing team or agency, this is the product to buy.",28/4/2020,"Pros: It's structured but flexible enough to adjust to your workflow and processes. You can have a high-level view or granular. It's great for marketing teams and agencies who want to have full transparency with their external clients or internal clients, by inviting them to view projects and assigning them tasks if needs be.","Cons: Nothing really, the features that we miss are often already in development. We see them making great updates regularly."
300,300 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Changed. My. Life.”,"Overall: I can't really complain with Asana, they have a great product with great support and good onboarding videos, courses etc. to get the most out of it.",4/12/2019,"Pros: It's so simple and intuitive, works in extremely well with colleagues and even guest accounts (clients, stakeholders etc.)","Cons: There are quite a few really cool features that Asana have made, but they have a tiered pricing system for those features, per user. It's worth it if your organisation uses it everyday."
301,301 Asana,Asana,Nate E.,Director,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,9,“Essential To Our Organization”,Overall: My nonprofit doesn't own any office space so the ability to track tasks online is essential. Asana allows us to work together while never being in the same space physically. It is also very important in helping us collaborate on projects and track the progress of our goals.,3/12/2019,Pros: - We can easily work together while not owning office space. - Collaboration on projects. - I can assign and track tasks given to team members. - I can follow along on projects I'm not a part of. - Grouping of tasks into larger projects. - Assigning due dates and tasks to people is easy.,Cons: - Wish free platform had more features. - Doesn't have a central place to view completed tasks and projects.
302,302 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Photography,2+ years,5,4,4,4,4,8,“Asana”,"Overall: I really like using Asana with my day to day projects. It lets me time track, assign other people projects as well as being able to comment, add images and videos and keep things in a clean, organized way.",21/11/2019,"Pros: Great way to track your tasks, track your time, see where projects are and who is in charge of them.","Cons: Some learning curve but not terrible. It really takes the whole team to make this software work and if you only have 4 people using it out of your office of 20, then it's not going to work the way you want it to."
303,303 Asana,Asana,Angelique U.,Software Engineer,Real Estate,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,10,“Top Free Work-Management Tool!”,"Overall: For collaboration with other teams outside development team, I would prefer to use Asana as it is much more user friendly management tool to non-technical people in the company. I use it personally to track my to-dos aside from my work tasks.",13/11/2019,"Pros: Firstly, it is free to use if it is for personal use but it is paid for enterprise account. I liked the feature wherein whenever I complete a task, there are random things(unicorn, confetti, cat) appearing on my screen. It motivates me to work and complete more tasks. I also liked that I can share projects to other people even if they are not listed on our domain. I also liked having customizable fields for the tasks.","Cons: There is nothing to dislike in this product. I can suggest new features that may be useful, though. I think it would be better to add a feature that shows the status like if it was seen by a person. This would give us an update on the tasks. Sometimes people do not respond on the task so we are not sure if they have been informed on the specifics of the task."
304,304 Asana,Asana,Umeed M.,Frontend Developer,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,4,,,10,“Simplifies managing your work”,"Overall: A few years ago, when I started with Asana I always said if you use Asana as intended you'll love it. Use it as a means to organize your activities and team goals. Today? Asana has developed into an incredible tool that also allows you to utilize Project Management tools in a wonderful clean UI. Highlight recommend.",8/8/2019,"Pros: Robust feature when assigning tasks with the ability to create notes and subtasks within each parent task. Setting up tags to filter content to suit your needs (makes scrums with various teams so much easier when especially when meeting on the fly) Quick and has a fairly clean UI, I've never experienced load issues, so its easy and quickly accessible. Ability to create private projects/posts/activities etc is wonderful With the recent updates we can use Asana more like a project management tool where there are project timelines and gant charts etc.","Cons: For some items, the view is too zoomed in (like the Calendar) and zooming out isn't possible which makes it difficult to understand what I'm looking at."
305,305 Asana,Asana,Iqbal A.,Director,Education Management,2+ years,4,4,4,,4,9,"“Asana, a great tool for project management”",Overall: I like using Asana to keep our team on top of deadlines and progress made with ongoing and future projects. It is a great tool that anyone can pick up fairly quickly. The design is very user friendly and the email notifications always help you stay connected and on top of the updates.,7/8/2019,Pros: Very easy to set-up Easy to create projects and share with members of the team The automated email feature is great to stay on top of deadlines and updates The calendar view is great Ability to upload files directly into Asana Ability to comment on tasks Ability to add sub-tasks Ability to print lists of tasks,Cons: The emails from Asana can sometimes be overwhelming They could create a desktop app version that is more helpful and easier to use They need to make it easier to figure out what is locked in the free version
306,306 Asana,Asana,Julia S.,Chief of People and OrgDev,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,4,4,4,,,9,“Asana is helpful for project management and to do lists”,,23/7/2019,,"Cons: - It defaults my to do list to a random order, and every time I login I have to sort if by ""Due First"" -- I don't know why there isn't a way to change the default"
307,307 Asana,Asana,Liam S.,Innovation Designer,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,6,“There when I need it”,"Overall: Asana is a great project management software if that's the problem you're looking to solve. It's ideal for a team, and even accommodates working with outside guests or contractors on a short-term basis. We've appreciated that it's a platform that more and more people are using and that it's always being improved with creative new ideas and functionality.",31/3/2019,"Pros: I appreciate the role of project management software, even though I don't use it all that much. When I need it, Asana is there for me. It's intuitive to use, the design is simple, and the functionality is powerful. For those who love to play in project management software, this is definitely the platform I recommend. It's a bonus that you can integrate so many other apps, and even email tasks to your to-do list. Plus the app is great for when you're on the go.","Cons: Some people don't appreciate that Asana gives them yet another inbox to stay on top of. And if it's not integrated into their workflow, they may be getting assignments and project updates on the platform but not remembering to check it. For collaborative projects, Asana is a group lift. Everyone has to be committed to using it to make it work. Some people do use it just to track their own tasks, which works up to a point, but it's really designed to use as a team. If you're willing to try it and invest the time, you may find it's a great solution for you. If you're a lone wolf, you may not experience the benefits."
308,308 Asana,Asana,Anthony H.,Service Desk Manager,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,9,“Asana - Easy to use follow up / collaborative board”,"Overall: We discovered Asana when we needed a better way to organize our follow ups. We implemented various different boards / teams. We also made follow up boards for our branches / departments. This allowed the management team to do visual inspections at the remote locations and input the needed changes for the other teams to see. This improved our efficiency when it came to follow up work. We also use the product to help us when we test systems. We would make a minor/major bug board. As we discovered issues with a product, we would list the severity of the bug on Asana. This allowed our System Administration team to be aware of issues, while we continued to QA test the product.",25/2/2019,Pros: Application had a clean look and feel. It was easy to make templates and organize information The visibility for your team to see tasks and follow ups Ability to put dates / notes / tasks within tasks / etc. Ability to organize your teams into separate teams with visibility restrictions depending on access,"Cons: No real complaints, product works great and has a great price point. Maybe a lack of different type of boards, more templates would be nice."
309,309 Asana,Asana,Triloky M.,Software Developer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,5,5,4,9,“Interactive for tasks in project management”,Overall: We coordinated all our tasks with help of Asana and it made our lives very easy. We can track our progress more better now and suggest edits to team just by commenting on relevant tasks. Time commitments are meeting and by integration with third party tools it has become part of everyday development life. The development around the globe with different time zones is effective with Asana.,26/1/2019,Pros: It has almost every feature needed in a project manager. From a great timeline to tags for the searching in different projects it amuses masses with a clean UI. We can set our priorities and as well as know the progress of the team. Asana features indeed best visual plans. It is very easy to learn and we can get to the root of the problems very quick with help of Asana. We can keep keep track of work with the comments on each task. It is good for both small as well large projects. The calendar is available for each small task.,Cons: If we talk about features it has most of things available though I would like to suggest that we can manage our notification with more ways. On the price front it is little pricier and there can be more plans available suiting needs for different organization and the team members involved in using Asana.
310,310 Asana,Asana,Stacy G.,Digital Marketing Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,9,“Great project management tool”,"Overall: It's been a great solution for our business, but always room for improvement.",3/12/2018,"Pros: Very intuitive & easy to navigate. Able to create subtasks and dependencies. Able to sort tasks by due date, assignee, or custom fields. Can create section dividers for task list. Can create multiple teams within an organization. Can add followers to a task to be notified when notes are made or the task is marked complete. Can choose to make tasks public or private. Unicorns and yetis randomly fly across your screen when you check off a task.","Cons: There are some issues with subtasks for reoccurring tasks where they show up in your list multiple times & if you check them off they come right back. The project list on the left side defaults to newest task on bottom. There isn't an option to sort them any other way, although you can manually drag & rearrange. I wish there was a client level above the project level. We have to list our clients as projects, our projects as tasks, our tasks as subtasks, etc."
311,311 Asana,Asana,Ben B.,Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,5,,4,10,“Asana every day keeps the task list at bay”,"Overall: Asana is a fantastic task management tool. We utilise it across the team, and everyone can use it. Not a work day goes by without checking in with Asana for what my priorities for the day are.",27/9/2018,"Pros: Asana is key to our operations. Every member of staff uses it and manages a large proportion if not all of their work through it. It handles sub tasks, and sub-sub tasks well. Everyone has their own task list, as well as the option to create projects, in either list or board layout. Recurring tasks are simple to use, and the option to collaborate with those outside of your organisation on specific projects can really help ensure everyone is on the same page and has access to the same resources.","Cons: Sometimes the Today/Upcoming/Later feature causes issues. Tasks can automatically move through these stages based on predetermined rules, but if a task is moved to the wrong stage it will never automatically trigger - a small problem, but we've found tasks incomplete for months, because they were accidentally moved."
312,312 Asana,Asana,Daniel W.,Founder,Internet,2+ years,4,4,4,5,5,9,“Project and Process Management Made Easy”,"Overall: Asana is my go to resource for project management. I've tried so many different project management apps, but nothing compares to the ease of use and robustness of Asana. It's not perfect, no software platform is, but it gives me the control I need to make sure I've completed every task for a specific project.",25/9/2018,"Pros: What I like: - I can invite people inside and outside my organization to work on a team or project with me - The first 15 team members are free! - You can completely map out a process, save that process, duplicate it for future use on new projects, and never have to worry about missing a critical step in your workflow - Team members only have access to the teams they are assigned to - I can export the processes that I've built inside Asana for safe keeping - Ability to choose between Trello style boards or the standard To Do list",Cons: What I don't like: - No shared calendars between teams or organizations. I work on multiple teams and having to look at and maintain different calendars is a pain in the backside - No shared dashboard or home screen for different organizations. You have to change to a different organization before you can view any info about projects or teams
313,313 Asana,Asana,Bhavesh N.,Founder/Creative Director,Education Management,2+ years,4,3,4,,5,8,“Great Productivity Tool for Left-Brain Thinkers”,"Overall: If you are a linear, logical (left-brain) thinker, this tool may work great for you. If you are a more creative type and seek more of an exploration and less of an execution, this tool *may* frustrate you. In my own experience, I use Asana for getting things done where order and execution are important, even critical, where there are deadlines to meet and little room for creative exploration. In the area of my life where I want to more of a creative freedom, I use other tools.",6/8/2018,Pros: - Allows me to easily collect ideas and to-do items. - Allows me to easily create an order out of ideas in a linear fashion where step-by-step execution is important. - Gives me a single place to gather most of my to-do lists and organize them so that I can get them done *efficiently.*,"Cons: - It's easy to get going but does take some effort to start using it well. - If you are creative, lateral-thinking type, this tool may frustrate you as it is designed for organization and execution, not creative exploration. However, if you stick with long enough, you may find some create venues to explore your creative ideas."
314,314 Asana,Asana,Beth S.,Director,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,,,,,“Great for light duty task and project management”,,20/7/2018,,"Cons: As of the last time I looked for it, Asana doesn't offer gantt charting functionality (nor task duration (start _and_ end dates) and dependencies) in it's free product. My small organization found that we outgrew Asana the moment our projects became more complex with many moving parts and dependencies and we finally ended up switching to Wrike which we've been using for the past 3 years quite successfully."
315,315 Asana,Asana,Tomasz M.,Senior Web Developer,Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“The BEST team / task organizational software out there.”,,10/7/2018,,"Cons: I can't even mention any cons. Whatever issues I've had, I went to their forum and posted it there. All ideas are reviewed and responded to."
316,316 Asana,Asana,Andreina C.,Project Manager,Unspecified,2+ years,5,4,4,,,9,“I like working with Asana because it makes easier for me to supervise a project”,,9/7/2018,,"Cons: I would improve email notifications with more personalized options to create alerts adjusted to my needs. It is also necessary to improve the way in which the summary of these notifications is presented, sometimes it is confusing to do a chronological follow-up from the email and also is difficult to answer some comments from the mail, which forces you to open the application."
317,317 Asana,Asana,Shenandoah D.,Chief Operations Officer,1-10 employees,2+ years,4,5,4,4,,8,"“Different than Trello, but not necessarily better”","Overall: The premium benefits of Asana are not really worth the upgrade, but it is a powerful free software platform that is easy to utilize with groups. Just make sure you turn the email notifications off.",5/6/2018,"Pros: Asana is extremely visually pleasing and it is easy to monitor tasks, projects, responsibilities, and deadlines. There is a wealth of information that can be contained and while Trello looks a little bit better, Asana seems to be more powerful.","Cons: Asana is *horrible* on cell phones and the mobile app is essentially non-functional, which is a huge deal for our team. There is a limit to the number of projects that can be assigned to a single cell that is not changed in any upgrade package, which means that over time our team has had to create multiple duplicates of the same project in order to assign it everywhere it belongs. The attachments feature is also not very optimized and trying to retrieve attachments from Asana does not work well, which means we double-upload everything into both Asana and Slack, where it is more easy to find down the road."

J.,Corporate Marketing Management,Telecommunications,2+ years,4,5,5,4,5,10,"“Even using free account/options, found incredibly quick and perfect for team project management.”","Overall: Quick and easy task management- and outshined other free options we had tried. Team needed to familiarize themselves with the structure a bit- the GUI and use... but once using it daily, it became VERY useful, and could select the type of reminders/updates sent to your email inbox. Love the ability for users to assign tasks to each other, or to know when a subtask was completed in order to further progress on a parent task.",20/4/2018,"Pros: The interface seems quite intuitive with tasks and subtasks, each able to be individually set with dates and owners. Makes it quite quick to set up task maangement without a large learning curve and share with a team almost immediately to be up and running in minutes.","Cons: Someimtes confusing in swtiching from main task to subtasks, in that the viewable area isn't quite clear as to the heirarchy - can make it easy to accidentally put in a due date in the wrong place, or assign the wrong level of task to a person. Sometimes drop-down menus seemed to fall below the viewable screen area- troublesome to scroll or be unable to select due dates from drop-down menus."
319,319 Asana,Asana,Aaron Francis C.,Professional Actor,Performing Arts,2+ years,4,5,4,5,,7,“a miracle for the disorganized -- you just gotta commit!”,,5/4/2018,,"Cons: This app, for all its wonderful internal qualities, fails to integrate with some of the other most useful programs. I vote that the Asana team devote an immense amount of time [though I'm sure this has been approached as an issue a thousand times over] to the relationships with other up-n-comers in the app developer field. PLEASE N thanks"
320,320 Asana,Asana,Kai F.,Hospitality/Service Department,Health,2+ years,4,4,5,4,5,9,“Keeping track of your tasks has never been THIS easy!”,"Overall: I can finally keep track of what is important for each day without forgetting or losing any notes, details, contact etc. I have everything right there when and wherever I want it.",18/7/2017,"Pros: Before Asana, I usually had to write down everything that I wanted to keep track of either on a sheet of paper or my forgetful, work saturated mind that would either be forgotten or thrown away. Now I can just write them down in a blink of an eye and have the program track my cases and notify me when they are due. I can now have absolute oversight on my entire department, team, and company. Being organized has never been so productive","Cons: There are not that many cons when using Asana, but there still exist one or two to mention. One being that their Customer Support does not have direct and fast communication system that can definitively make you uneasy when in a rush. A few features and a bit hidden and could be forgotten how they are used by the user due to the complexity of the UI that can definitively be improved with a little tweaking and customer feedback."
321,321 Asana,Asana,Reuben R.,Learning and Development Manager,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,4,5,,4,,,“Simple & Effective Project and Team Collaboration”,"Overall: Asana values simplicity, collaboration and effectiveness, and this is what makes it such an attractive platform. We tried a number of other project management platforms for our small team, many with more traditional corporate features than Asana, but after a while the motivation to use these platforms dropped, and it became a chore to use them. Asana was a breath of fresh air for my team with its easy to use and intuitive interface. It allows for rapid task creation and assignment that works just as easily for an individual as for a team. We use it to 'dump' all of our ideas and to-dos, and then we can sort them into projects, etc... We even keep our team meeting minutes in Asana, and carry over the past un-completed action items to the next meeting. Simple drag and drop. If you're interested, Asana has a forever free package for up to 5 users, which is more than enough for you to get a feel of what the platform is like. I suggest you give it a try.",18/9/2015,Pros: - Intuitive and simple interface - Ease of use; uses standard SaaS operating procedures so users can figure things out quickly - My staff actually like to use it because it's so easy vs. other platforms they said the looks demotivated them - Simple permission based projects and following capabilities,"Cons: There are not too many cons for Asana. People who might criticize that it doesn't have things like built in gantt chart (they can use Instagannt app) are mistaking features for PM methodology, and Asana values simplicity. That being said the one thing I would like to see from Asana would be more integrations; specifically, I would like to see more integrations on the attachment side. It would be great if they could attach files from Office 365 or notes from Evernote (right now Google Drive, Dropbox, and Box)."
322,322 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Accounting,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,9,“Great product ”,Overall: Very happy. It's a pretty cluttered market but I like Asana and they constantly add features.,12/9/2020,"Pros: Very easy to organize, track tasks, collaborate, and cut down on back and forth emails. Nice to have a centralized repository I can acxess from anywhere.","Cons: PowerBI integration is pretty bad and large extracts very slow. Also, some make like other products better due to tie ins to source repositories, but I don't need that."
323,323 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,10,“Very nice collaborative project management tool”,Overall: It's never been so easy to collaborate in projects in a digital way. It's a very nice tool for teams collaboration and task management,10/9/2020,"Pros: Easy to set up and to invite teams to participate. You can easily set up your project activities, collaborate, assign tasks to others and control the project timeline.","Cons: The incapacity to export a project plan and to create dependencies between tasks. I'm using the free edition, so may be in the paid version this could be possible."
324,324 Asana,Asana,Renier A.,Project Manager Jr.,Logistics and Supply Chain,2+ years,5,4,4,4,4,8,“Asana as Project Management Software”,"Overall: My overall experience with Asana is very good because I don't lose track on every project, task or activity. I also easily collaborate with every team members sharing file is very easy. The software is very user friendly. You can track your project easily and very convenient, also you can track and look back for projects that are finished and files you have uploaded.",25/8/2020,"Pros: What I like the most to Asana is the tracking of your task activity or project. It reminds you how many days do you need to complete a task it sends a notification so you don't miss any task or activity you can track it. It is very helpful for tracking project, having a good timeline track by it's own sending out notifications so you don't lost which activity is your priority keeping you on track. Project collaboration is also ease at use with other team members.",Cons: I think I would say is minimize some buttons some are too redundant buttons. But overall everything is very user friendly I would say simplify is the best term.

Various channels for different tasks or various partners, reconciliations, basic use, versatile application. he general experience I even have had with Asana is extraordinary. extremely simple to share and set targets, resolve gives quicker, and a general sentiment of reference to the group.",12/6/2020,"Pros: What I favor the chief about the Asana is that it opens a swap world for a direct coordinated effort. the blending in with different applications and its inherent capacities assists with staying associated and drew in with the group. I truly like the channel's usefulness of Asana, permitting you to isolate across various discussions and subjects.","Cons: The greatest con I even have with Asana must accomplish more with the experience of my colleagues: they need experienced issues with the most functionalities like accepting/sending/composing messages. Other than that, I feel that the apparatus might be an extraordinary one to work together with."
326,326 Asana,Asana,Bonnie G.,Software Developer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,9,“Excellent tool for team tasks without having to be from the office”,"Overall: Asana is being used to bring better order when it comes to assigning tasks to different team members whether it is a particular project, this allows tasks to be carried out successfully and to move forward quickly and without duplication. or forgetting any of these, so thanks to this the workflow is less heavy and fun.",23/5/2020,"Pros: I like Asana because it is a key software when it comes to carrying out project management, it is easy to use and configure, so adapting to its use does not take much time, it is quite useful to allow adding multiple members to a element in specific since this way it can be completed faster, in addition to the fact that it is much simpler to avoid duplication of tasks and to monitor each progress of the project, the one that provides templates is a great advantage since it is easier to start a project without having to carry out the preparations again but on the contrary it only starts based on these, also its calendar makes it possible to have a better vision of everything that must be carried out so that we can work more organized and efficient.","Cons: Asana tends to send many notification emails to each member, so receiving so many emails can be a hassle, since it is no longer pleasant for notifications to be so persistent, but even so Asana is ideal for teamwork, whether professional or personal."
327,327 Asana,Asana,Emily G.,Customer Service Support Manager,Food & Beverages,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,8,“Asana is present in all projects”,"Overall: The general experience is extraordinary. The product truly gives extraordinary oversight to all or any performing on the tasks. Indeed, even with the free form, the asana apparatus has great highlights and is very instinctive in regular use, introducing several specialized issues. Asana is a wonderful item to showcase cooperation and supply brief gratitude to looking after cutoff times. As a little business, it really is that the essential path during which we keep up a Marketing schedule for content.",13/4/2020,"Pros: The convenience truly leaves Asana from another programming. Undertakings are regularly characterized effectively and can increase genuine oversight when done accurately. Regardless of being a touch weird toward the beginning of utilization, the device has gotten basic for all regions that utilization the instrument.","Cons: We can just check them as complete, as long as we are adjusting the product to use for a somewhat increasingly restricted reason, this probably won't be all-around material yet it may be pleasant to line task statuses, for example, you can extend statuses."

It is easy to see at a glance what's been completed and what still needs to get done. The project features are helpful to keep everything organized. It is perfect for a streamlined, easy to use project planner, scheduler and to do tool.",31/12/2019,"Pros: Asana is easy to use, easy to set up and easy to see at a glance what needs to get done.",Cons: Making changes to the view after you set up a project is not easy / near impossible.
329,329 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer & Network Security,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Asana is awesome for task management!”,"Overall: Asana is super great for task management, we use it to assign tasks to teammates and make sure things get done.",3/12/2019,"Pros: Asana is super easy to use, has lots of in depth features that help with your task management, and if you're lucky you get a little surprise when you complete a task",Cons: I wish that making tasks a sub task of another task was more accessible in their menu system. it is a feature I use often and it is a pain to menu dive to find it.
330,330 Asana,Asana,Rus N.,Director of Research,Investment Management,2+ years,4,4,4,,4,8,“Pretty decent but some integrations clunky”,Overall: We use Asana throughout the organisation and have found it very useful and powerful,4/10/2019,"Pros: The basic out-of-the-box Asana is pretty easy for the average user to get to grips with, although we did have our project manager spend time with each staff member to ensure it was being used consistently.",Cons: Some of the integrations are a bit clunky - for example getting any kind of reasonably sensible export of tasks/projects etc requires the Asana2Go extension in Chrome; Gannt charting is absent from basic implementation; Portfolios feature would be more useful if it notified you when a Team adds a new Project.
331,331 Asana,Asana,Jason M.,Photographer,Automotive,2+ years,5,5,5,,4,8,“Great for project management”,"Overall: I utilize this a lot with my teammates, and design team. It works wonders in keeping us all organized and keeping complicated tasks visible",17/9/2019,"Pros: I love how intuitive this software is. The UI is well thought out, and similar to a lot of messaging software out there, So people can use it and almost automatically know where things are And what can be done.",Cons: The cost of it is really outside any small company to justify utilizing any of the extended functions
332,332 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,4,3,5,,,6,“Asana Review”,"Overall: My overall experience has definitely been positive. The software is helpful in keeping everything in one place. I'm typically a paper and pencil kind of person, but Asana may have converted me. I'm also the kind who loses those papers where I write things down to do. It's nice to always know where to look to see tasks given to me. They go to the same place in ""my tasks,"" no matter who gave me that task, too, which is also an excellent feature that helps me stay organized. Definitely recommend",22/3/2019,"Pros: Now that I know how to use Asana, I'm impressed with the about of features available on Asana. If everyone in your organization actually uses the software, it's a great and robust way to keep track of what everyone is working on, when it needs to be done, and how much you have left to do. From tasks to a sort of e-mail, to a search function allowing you to type in key words, Asana has a great deal of functions and features that allow you to keep your whole work life right there in one place.","Cons: With the pros comes a major con--user friendly. Like I said, now that I know how to use Asana, it's great. But it wasn't super simple to figure out the order the software would place things in. I also don't like that when you finish a ""task,"" that task completely disappears from your list. I wish it would go to a ""completed"" list so you could easily go back and look at what you did."
333,333 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Health,2+ years,5,3,5,4,4,7,"“Perfect organizational tool for a start-up, corporation or even personal use.”","Overall: Powerful tool to bring the team together and skip the unnecessary meetings to update the organizational whole. Perfect for the individual, or any size team looking to maximize productivity. Pricing is fair.",27/1/2019,"Pros: ""My tasks"" tab is perfect for viewing tasks personally created or assigned to you. Sectioned off by date and importance; Today, upcoming, or later. Calendars with date ranges for the beginning and the deadline of said tasks. Create lists, plan schedules, track expenses or goals. Project lists can be made into templates as to minimize the need to create one each time. I.E new hire task list etc. The ability to add new people to the task is as easy as typing their name into the comments and assigning a personal task to take over the project. A ""files"" tab keeps all of your documents in one easy to view page instead of having to store them elsewhere. The ability to add the google chrome extension lets you add tasks to Asana directly from your browser. Asana Academy- Tutorial videos on learning how to navigate Asana.","Cons: The wide variety of options makes this a bit overwhelming to learn to utilize Asana to its potential. Upgrading from a small group isn't available, going from one person to two, you'd need to upgrade to the five-person tier. Try for free length is vague."
334,334 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Publishing,2+ years,5,4,4,,4,9,“Asana for the win!”,Overall: I'm so glad I came back to this program instead of letting my initial impression 4 years ago keep me at bay. The benefits have been greatly realized since then and I can't imagine not having it as part of our workflow management.,17/12/2018,"Pros: Asana used to be the bane of my existence to use for project or task management. In the years since I first tried it, it has matured greatly into a product I am proud to stand behind. On a personal level, I can manage my daily tasks. On a team level, I can organize our project types and assign duties. On a corporate level, we can cross-departmentally set up, assign and execute projects and keep all members on task. It is user friendly and offers a variety of displays dependent on user preference. You can also conduct chats on individual projects seamlessly in the program.","Cons: Prior to my re-introduction to it in 2018 I would have told you that I disliked the interface, customizations and ability to conduct any business efficiently within the program. Now I can say that the only thing I like least is the time it takes to effectively set up (but that isn't an Asana exclusive issue. All programs take time to develop.)"
335,335 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,4,4,4,,5,9,“Asana was game-changing for our development team.”,,14/12/2018,,"Cons: There are some features that look useful, but are behind a paywall. To upgrade to Asana pro is significantly expensive, and it's not clear to us that the additional features would be worth the extra cost. So it is a bit annoying to feel a little hamstrung with some aspects of Asana, especially a limit on the number of users on a particular project team. However, to be fair, all of the functionality we have taken advantage of so far has been free, which is pretty amazing given how integral it is to our development team's operations."
336,336 Asana,Asana,Juana R.,Analista de ventas,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,5,5,4,4,9,“Spectacular tool to manage work teams ”,"Overall: My experience with Asana is very favorable, because it has allowed me to organize an organized register of treasure and hierarchy in the development of work, also efficiently implement communication between members of different projects and unify efforts in the fulfillment of duties .",30/11/2018,"Pros: The first thing to emphasize in this tool is its visual impression, it is very colorful and orderly, I also like the function of being able to track through time lines in tasks and communication about the project. At the moment of organizing tasks and prioritizing them, the software helps a lot by generating reminders and visibly establishing the most important tasks, as well as providing the opportunity to make calendars, send communications to other team members and integrate wonderfully with other platforms.","Cons: Some of the inconveniences with this software is mainly the delay when moving between one task and another or when seeing reflected at the moment of writing a communication or making a comment, perhaps due to the cloudiness. There is also the incongruity of having to duplicate each task at the time of assigning it to more than one person which can generate confusion in the same way that it does not being able to see all the tasks in general assigned to a member of the team but it is necessary to enter to each project to see them."
337,337 Asana,Asana,David M.,"Co-fouder, Head of Operations and Marketing",Aviation & Aerospace,2+ years,4,5,4,5,,9,“Indispensable! ”,"Overall: This product is great, and is at the core of how I run my small business (which is geographically spread out between 3 co-founders). It is SO MUCH MORE EFFICIENT than communicating via e-mail, especially with complex projects, that it pays for itself probably every single day. It has a few minor quirks, but they are actively rolling out new features and making it better and better. I can't recommend this product enough",3/11/2016,"Pros: This makes organizing and managing large amounts of project related planning (tasks, communication, etc) super easy and efficient. The mobile app is great.","Cons: The webpages don't always responds like they should (using the latest version of Safari). A simple re-load takes care of the issue, but it's annoying when it happens. I don't like how I have to expand the ""more projects"" on the left hand side of the screen instead of being able to automatically scroll down in them. I wish custom saved searches would allow you to add tasks (say within a specific project and assigned to a specific individual) by hitting return, just like in a normal project view. These are minor cons though in the grand scheme of things. Just some suggestions :-)"
338,338 Asana,Asana,Peter G.,IT Manager,Internet,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,8,“Great For Task or Project Management”,Overall:,10/10/2020,"Pros: The best thing about Asana is the features of that you get for free. For most people, the free version is going to be just fine for task and project management.","Cons: The bad thing about Asana is that if you do decide to go and purchase licenses, you can only purchase them in packs of five. So if you are a three-person team, you're going to end up paying for two extra licenses that you don't need."
339,339 Asana,Asana,Dayne S.,Director of Operations,Mechanical or Industrial Engineering,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,9,“More Features than Monday.Com”,Overall: Way more functions than Monday.com or other platforms. Fairly priced. Know your project management strategy/approach first then use this as a tool to facilitate. Not vice-versa.,8/9/2020,"Pros: The amount of features that this platform has is incredible. At first glance, Asana seems like the average project management system, but after using for a few months you start to learn how to use the programs nuances to increase project velocity, speed up deliverables, and create layers of ownership and accountability throughout robust projects.","Cons: It is not super intuitive at first. The key thing for any organization is going to be ""how do we use this to support or facilitate our current project management strategy."" It supports most project management philosophies. But because of that, there are lots of features and functions at your disposal which you may not use but dilute the intuitive nature of the program. But the key to overcoming this is having a strong project leader who knows how they want to use this; and simply train others to use only the functions which are critical to the team. Then people can learn more nuances later."
340,340 Asana,Asana,Deborah C.,Marketing Manager,Automotive,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Best Project Management Software Available”,,8/8/2020,,"Cons: It decreases the size of photos and attachments when uploaded to a task. For completing tasks, it's not a big deal. But you'll need somewhere else to share large files with team mates."

It helps management of teams. It's really easy to use it and it offers a lot of good features. Migrating from other tools was really easy because the user interface is really friendly.,Cons: The price for premium features is really expensive and there are a lot of features on the premium tier.

It's very basic as it is now and doesn't integrate very well cross-projects. But at the end of the day, they are always very open and driven by user suggestions and feedback, which makes their software even easier to use."
344,344 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Public Policy,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Mission Critical Software For Us”,"Overall: Excellent. If you are looking at Asana, consider looking at some of Paul Minors Asana trainings on YouTube. No affiliation, just a recommendation on content that has helped us step up our Asana game.",29/3/2020,"Pros: Like the title says, Asana is a critical tool for managing our team, projects and execution. Intuitive and flexible. Appreciated the addition of Trello-like Kanban boards.",Cons: Sometimes can be a *bit* slow to load. Other than that minor concern nothing worth raising relative to what we pay for a daily tool here.
345,345 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Great tool for planning and managing workflows and projects”,Overall: In my organization it has helped us a lot to better organize the work. It allows you to define the start and end dates for each task and who is responsible for executing it. This makes the way of working much more efficient and allows us to have a greater control of what we dedicate the resources to.,4/12/2019,"Pros: When we started using Asana in my organization, we were able to: define a model when planning projects, have a clearer overview, know precisely where each project is, improve the planning of all the projects developed and optimize the available resources.",Cons: Notices can be annoying because either you get many or you don't get any. The timeline is not clear if there are many subtasks

I've been a user for a while and I still discover new capabilities and integrations at times that I wish I had known about sooner.
347,347 Asana,Asana,Jillian H.,Client success manager,Accounting,2+ years,5,4,5,,,10,“Great tool to manage tasks”,Overall: We have projects for all our main tasks that keep the team in alignment. The due dates and assignment options make managing projects easier than any other tool we have tried.,2/7/2019,Pros: So many options to build out a plan. I love using project boards and milestones to see the overall plan.,Cons: There are so many features that I didn't find out about until recently. I wish there was a bit more real world training on the advanced features.
348,348 Asana,Asana,Ellen Marie D.,Business Woman,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,3,5,5,4,10,"“The ""Cork Board"" For Online Work”","Overall: Many of the features Asana offers can be found individually through other services online... but that's the thing. You need multiple services in order to get to where Asana is today! There's a project board, task board, you can set reminders, and more. Need a messaging app? Asana also has it built in! You can asign each task or project to anyone in your team, turn emails directly into tasks in Asana and more",4/6/2019,"Pros: You need to learn A LOT of the features however, when you get the hang of everything, it's a super duper useful tool to use especially if you have a number of projects and tasks going on at the same time. It keeps you organized and updated every step of the way. A really good feature is that it's 100% online and you can get your whole team onboard so everyone is inside the loop everyday","Cons: You need to learn many of the advanced features in order to take advantage of the software. Also, it might be a bit costly compared to other softwares that offer the same services but Asana is 100% worth it!"

Creating projects, and then granular tasks is simple and intuitive. It's especially useful to be able to assign tasks to team members and carry on conversations within the task. The free version is packed full of features and robust enough to get the job done. But if your organization is scaling, Asana has more features behind a pay wall that help to scale with you, like insights, timeline, and Portfolios. Asana integrates with a ton of other apps and services which is nice.",Cons: It would be nice to be able to assign a task to more than one person. And another big one would be having a global view of all tasks across workspaces would be amazing.
350,350 Asana,Asana,Dave S.,Finance and Project Management,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,3,4,3,3,8,“Asana Tool”,Overall: It has definitely helped our company become more organized and accountable from a management standpoint. We are clearly assigned items and it has history or creation date and the information can easily be input into the tasks.,30/11/2018,Pros: It has helped our organization keep deadlines and task management for the team in order. We used to use google docs and this keep a nice history of the tasks assigned and the information in them. You don't have to search through emails to find details it is nice to be able to attach documents and copy and paste emailed information right into the tasks. I also like that you can clearly see the history of commenting and such to know where things have progressed or project status.,Cons: There are some glitches in the assist task features but it has gotten better or we have gotten better at keeping a good handle on it. I wish there was a better copy and paste feature for tasks and assigning them to save time and be more efficient.
351,351 Asana,Asana,EBIN E.,Credit Analyst,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,5,5,3,8,"“Asana, great tool for tracking of bugs, but needs constant improvement”",Overall: We could save a lot of our time chasing bugs by adopting asana. This is a great tool and we totally recommend it to any types of teams.,22/8/2018,"Pros: We use asana premium features and is one of their early customers. As per us they are really good in their field. Their bug and effort tracking system is the best that I could see. A lot of good features including scheduling meetings, assigning bugs, tracking of issues, ability to add clients are some of the unique features that I see only in asana. They have good UI and mobile support. We really like Asana over their competitors since its easy to use and developer friendly. Their third party integration plugin is all first in class and works without any flaw.","Cons: A lot of changes has to be done on the functionality part, like for example when we assign a bug to a developer the client or PM in charge should know the time and all the updates happen on the thread this is not real time in the case of Asana. Also the customer support is not priority based, they put our issues to queue and solve the issue as per the queue. If they can cope up with all these then I strongly support Asana."
352,352 Asana,Asana,Alvaro M.,Account Manager,Utilities,2+ years,5,4,5,4,4,9,“Project Managers Haven!”,"Overall: Free version is very generous (offering to try Asana for up to 15 team members). The trial gave us the experience and confidence to finally subscribe to the paid app. Project management, collaboration and communication is house in one easy to use mobile/web app.",10/7/2018,"Pros: Project managers rejoice! Asana is a web and mobile app that will make life easy for managing small to big projects. The design and UI of this app is fantastic. It is intuitive even for the older (not so tech savvy) PMs to use. We use it for managing tasks, team communications and reminders, and project workflows. We started with the free version (which is just enough to support our 12 employee team. Note: Free version supports up to 15 team members). We loved it so much that we upgraded to the paid option. It was built on HTML5 which makes you really feel how fast and responsive it gets. This is important since it houses our project communications and collaboration.",Cons: The service requires you to be online (no offline option). This may pose as a challenge for remote team members who go to some project venue/site which has no/limited connectivity.

Also, it's easy to use interface allows you to add sections/milestones where you can put tasks and subtasks right under them. It gives you to ability to add people to a certain tasks so they can get update about the progress of that tasks. The tagging of a person in the comments section of the tasks is a great way to communicate too. My Task section gives the person a view of all the tasks assigned to him that day. Overall, I like Asana compared to Trello or Basecamp.","Cons: I guess the thing that I don't like about Asana that much is the ability to edit names of projects quickly. You need to click on ""Edit Name"" option to that compared to simply clicking on the name and editing it right away. The colors that you can use for labeling projects are limited too."

We use it for product development and launches and it works well. I like the way it seamlessly integrates with email as we can then track what needs to get done. We use the board and project views to give us an insight into what is happening on the project. It is so easy to use that even totally non-technical people are able to become competent users within a very short period of time.,14/2/2018,"Pros: It is easy to set up tasks, assign them to people and communicate information to them. I like the fact that emails are generated when tasks are updated and all the discussion is kept within the tasks.","Cons: It has zero resource management which is a major drawback for a project manager. The reporting capabilities are very limited and I don't use them at all. I would prefer more options to filter tasks. I use 'incomplete' all the time, but would like to drill down. There is no in between status for tasks progress. It is not so easy to set priorities for tasks and then to sort them accordingly."
355,355 Asana,Asana,Brad H.,Co-Founder,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“I love it!”,"Overall: Asana is by far the best Project Management software out there. I've tried multiple other softwares like Trello, Freedcamp, and others and none have met my needs like Asana does.",21/9/2017,"Pros: Asana has by far the best, most well designed user interface. It's so easy to use and every new team member we add is up to speed on how to use it in no time with very little training. It allows you to view tasks in both a list view and a cards view like Trello now. It allows for multiple views by project, team member, calendar etc. They give LOTS of value before asking you to pay. It's free for up to 15 users I believe, which is so awesome for us being a small startup that can't afford to pay for a project management software quite yet.","Cons: It can be a little slow loading at times. But honestly it's so amazing otherwise that I'd still much prefer it over any other software. And it has a large file upload size on the free tier, but it would be nice if there was a better way to sort/view just attachements."

I like the email reminders when tasks are coming up, so constant use of the app isn't necessary (Although too many of these can overwhelm an inbox). I really like the custom field dropdowns that allow you to prioritize project by a simple click of the mouse. One of the best features of Asana, is the ability to decrease emails in your inbox. Because you can easily comment on each assigned task, and follower can just look at each project as they see fit.","Cons: Learning most of the functionality and add-on apps associated with the software can be an incredible learning curve, that really everyone on your team needs to understand. When working with a multigenerational company, it can be hard to get those of the older generation to use it."

In addition, the kanban process style of task management isn't readily available on Asana, making it harder to track delayed projects and identify help needed from a macro perspective."

Not always the most easy to use right away but it is great once you have a system created.",Cons: Paid vs unpaid is drastic and not always cost effective compared to other tools. When a business is starting it doesn't always make sense to upgrade paid.

Now I easily share and assign work with my team and it also effectively track all on going projects and gives reliable services.,16/8/2020,"Pros: It was very difficult to manage several projects but Asana has completed my desire of a project management tool. I have been using Asana for years and having fantastic experience. Asana keeps on tracking effectively. I easily follow the progress of my projects and team members' performance. This tool helps me to share my workload and provide different ideas for managing projects efficiently. It tells me about the time I spent on a particular task, thus it is helping me to manage my time, along with workflow management.",Cons: Its automation features are not well developed in advanced ways. Otherwise it is great performing in our organization. I have not faced any major issue on this project management tool.

Asana has really streamlined communication between multiple people in our company working on the same project.,Cons: For the most part I like everything about the platform. It might be cool to be able to hit a button for a quick video chat with someone else working on the same project/task as you.
363,363 Asana,Asana,Bridgette H.,Project Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Wonderful easy to use UI”,,19/6/2020,,"Cons: I wish it was easier to import an email to an individual task, rather than just the project. If this is already possible, the feature is hard to find because I haven't. Thanks"
364,364 Asana,Asana,Christine S.,Assistant Director,Higher Education,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,“Asana fit our needs and then some!”,Overall: Excellent! I built our account from the ground up by myself and relied heavily on their training guides which I found incredibly helpful.,19/6/2020,"Pros: The user interface is appealing and easy to navigate, they offered several program integrations with what we already used, and they offered a mobile version.","Cons: The price tag is pretty high in order to get the functionality that we wanted/needed. While they make frequent updates, sometimes the new options are not what we would use and would prefer if they added some other features as requested on the community forum."
365,365 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,“Easy project tracking”,"Overall: Work very well overall, easy to learn, simple to use.",28/3/2020,"Pros: Makes it easy to organize projects, assign roles/tasks, and keep track workflows within our marketing team.","Cons: I receive too many messages in my email everyday from Asana for workflow stept/tasks that don't involve me or need my attention. I assume there must be a way to change this setting, but I haven't figured out a simple solution that doesn't completely remove me as a collaborator on the project."
366,366 Asana,Asana,Randy P.,Project Team Manager,Logistics and Supply Chain,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,8,“Asana is the best way to organize my work”,"Overall: The best part about Asana is the means by which adjustable it's in various features, you'll truly tailor it to the prerequisites of your particular group and venture. the measure of capacities that it's and its capacity to coordinate different applications and administrations inside it makes it very flexible and smart once you redo it to all or any of your needs. I likewise appreciate that there's a versatile application rendition.",24/3/2020,"Pros: At first, it had been a clean overpowering to arrange and type through the entirety of the highlights and uses, yet once you're utilized together with your group and discover a framework it's helpfully the chief valuable and natural workspace/task the board stage. There are in every case new highlights and combinations to be realized which is extraordinary to analysis and use as you develop with the stage.",Cons: With the entirety of its perpetual usefulness apparatuses - it are regularly a touch overwhelming in fixing the ideal format and structure of utilization for your group. There are various alternatives and highlights which will cause the product to appear to be excessively refined and advanced for ordinary use.
367,367 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Professional Training & Coaching,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Best PM Tool”,Overall: Amazing. It makes communicating so easy and it helps me to be more productive.,3/12/2019,Pros: I love the flexibility of this program. I've been using it for contact work and I love it more than the PM tool I use for myself. Adana can be used for managing almost anything. Even the free version is useful.,Cons: The only font I can think of is I haven't found away to remove or delete old organizations from my account.
368,368 Asana,Asana,Heather H.,Social Media Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,5,4,5,8,“Asana for Marketing Agency”,Overall: Asana helps with task management with to-dos. Helps to eliminate dropped-balls and missed deadlines.,24/9/2019,"Pros: The free trial for Asana was great to assign to-dos for coworkers, but what I love the most is the Timeline feature. I'm a very visual learner so seeing the progress of a specific campaign or event is super helpful to see in one easy format. I also like being able to move a to-do back to a later date if we're waiting on another aspect to be finished before we can move on.",Cons: There is definitely a learning curve when first starting. It takes about a week to get settled and really understand the product.
369,369 Asana,Asana,Yorick D.,Manager,Internet,2+ years,4,4,4,5,5,9,“Asana”,Overall: I have been using this for a few years now and i think this is the best task management platform for a company it is a little overpriced but worth it,5/9/2019,"Pros: Like the way you can set up projects and ad task for multiple people. You can setup peridoc task. Also, set up personal projects where nobody else can see.",Cons: The integration with Flock is limited. It would be great if we could consolidate similar projects. Don't like the weekly email that comes in to upgrade from the current plan.
370,370 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Telecommunications,2+ years,4,4,3,3,5,7,“Asana Review”,"Overall: My overall experience with Asana is that it is great for a new, small business that is just starting out and does not want to or have the money to spend on a more efficient and complex management tool. With a small group, you see each other or can talk to each other often and easily that you don't have to rely on Asana to do things for you, but it is helpful in getting an overview or making sure you don't miss anything.",28/8/2019,"Pros: What I like most about this software is that you are able to plan out tasks and assign them to the people that need to work on them. You are also able to set deadlines, download the app onto your phone for on-to-go use, and see what others are working on so nothing is missed.","Cons: What I like least about this software is that there is a manual process in moving the tasks. For example, if I was assigned a task, once I have completed it, I have to remember to go into Asana and manually move it to the next state or the next person. Moreover, there aren't notifications that you can receive when someone assigns something to you or changes something that had your name on it. You have to physically go into the app to see those things."
371,371 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Management Consulting,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,8,“Intuitive UI for Project and Task Management”,Overall: It is great for keeping track of tasks and for team collaboration. The paid version has advanced project management tools (e.g. Gantt Charts). Can also be used for recurring to-do lists and meeting agendas,9/8/2019,Pros: I like how tech friendly it feels. Lots of keyboard shortcuts and intuitive structure for how different parts of the software are implemented and connected,Cons: You need a paid version to control user access within an organization.
372,372 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Graphic Design,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“So much... for Nothing”,,18/7/2019,,Cons: I kind of wish they had a standalone app that could be installed. I realize its web based but somtimes I think it would be easier if I could pull it out of my browser... one less tab open.
373,373 Asana,Asana,Daniel E.,IT Director,Religious Institutions,2+ years,4,4,4,,,7,“Keeping The Unorganized Organized”,,8/7/2019,,Cons: Asana does a lot of things right so there is little to complain about. If I were to nitpick something it would be that it can be confusing how to properly archive your completed projects or find your archived projects.
374,374 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Education Management,2+ years,4,5,4,3,4,8,“Asana is amazing for projects”,Overall: My team and I use asana for recruiting. We plan out the different steps in recruiting as tasks and tag the stakeholders involved with deadlines for each task included. Scaling at a faster rate meant recruiting for 20 - 30 roles a month. These thirty roles lived in Asan and projects and made reporting easy especially when linked to instigant and stakeholder track progress of each role through to planning for onboarding.,13/2/2019,Pros: 1. I like how you can plan for multiple projects in the same platforms and have subtask that falls under the major task. 2. That I can tag people responsible for each task and the date when the task is due. 3. I loved the reminders they sent via emial and keeps you upto date on task deadlines 4. I like the comment section on each subtask section. That I tag comments a teammate in the comment.,"Cons: 1. That I have can not tag a person who is not in my group (team), i found myself haveing to add them in my team then tag them on a comment. 2."
375,375 Asana,Asana,Jash T.,Crazy Senior Software Developer,Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“It is what I was looking for”,,25/12/2018,,Cons: I am bothered by the lack of the opportunity to back up all my information
376,376 Asana,Asana,Jesse J.,Lead Web Developer,Retail,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Asana is at the top of the game for web-based project management software”,Overall:,27/11/2018,"Pros: The things that I like most about Asana is the fact that you can create tasks and then create sub-tasks inside of those so you can have an umbrella task and then complete individual items that make up that task to get a more granular perspective of completion. The team and user management of Asana is on-par for the course if not top of the game, in my opinion, as far as these sort of things go. I personally just like how detailed I can get with everything in Asana and if ever asked this will be my first go-to. Of course, I am also a huge fan of the flying unicorns and narwhals when you complete a task",Cons: I think that the thing I liked least about Asana was probably that there is a bit of a steep learning curve for people who are not used to an outfit like Asana. This can lead to some people feeling burnt out on it pretty quickly if they don't properly take the time to learn their way around.
377,377 Asana,Asana,Tom B.,Assistant Director of Creative Services,Higher Education,2+ years,4,5,4,,,8,“Simple Task-Based Team Organizer”,"Overall: I manage a small team of video assistants who all work on different aspects of different videos together. Asana helps us have a central hub where all of these small tasks can be organized and tracked with ease. It's far from an all-in-one solution for teamwork projects (like most software packages are), but it's ease of use and clean design is appealing to all of us and it's been a big help both when we are all together in a team meeting, or all at home.",4/10/2018,"Pros: The best part of Asana is it's ease of use. As soon as a team member logs in, they almost immediately recognize how the system works and what they are responsible for. The entire platform is based on individuals checking tasks off within a larger project. Asana makes this even easier with a clean design, responsive objects, and instant connectivity.","Cons: After a while of use, I realized that Asana is great for what it is, but can be limiting. It works great for task-based assignments and to quickly track those tasks, but it's limited on sharing to people outside of your team and creating more complex tasks and projects. It also limits the number of people on your team in the free version."
378,378 Asana,Asana,Sarah M.,Advocacy Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,“Pretty intuitive and great for Marketing depts ”,"Overall: Like I said, easy to use tool, perfect for standard or creative project management.",13/9/2018,"Pros: The UI is great and the platform is easy to use overall. You don't realize how nice it is until you try another project management tool. I've used several and Asana is definitely the easiest and prettiest. I used it on a marketing team and it was easy to build out a project plan, make lists, assign tasks to your teammates, and to communicate via the tasks without being overly technical seeming. I've used Jira for project management, as well, and it's definitely more of a tool for engineers - I am not sure why other departments would use it, but it turns out they do. Smartsheets is robust, but overwhelming, depending on the type of project. Wrike is ok too, but I didn't use it enough to truly have an opinion. So, I guess I'd say if you need an easy-to-use project tool, and you don't need a ton of technical information (i.e. release management or something of that nature), then Asana would be a smart pick.","Cons: Well, I wish our company had tried the paid version. This is not a con at all. I heard the deluxe version of Asana is pretty slick, so that would be great to experience next time around."
379,379 Asana,Asana,Ravi S.,Consultant,51-200 employees,2+ years,5,5,4,5,4,8,“I believe Asana is the complete solution for project/task management.”,"Overall: This tool provided ease to the company's project management. Especially, users don't have to be technical, asana is user-friendly.",27/7/2018,"Pros: Asana has the feature to address, create, store, and share all the files and documents within my team. I love the Kanban board, this helps me to organize and manage Project Sprints accordingly. Best feature is 'Integration', It allows me to connect to most of my platform that makes our work easy. Very easy to use and efficient overall. It just took 1-2 weeks to get my hands on with all the features.","Cons: 1. Asana doesn't have an 'automated' bug tracking feature. It would be nice to have that. Because it really required in some of our projects. 2. Asana needs to have a lock feature because we use task description to document our finalized requirements and sometimes unknowingly, some of the users in our team may erase or edit that requirements which are creating many confusion and errors."
380,380 Asana,Asana,Dimitris R.,"Partner, CRM Director",Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,9,“A valuable tool for cooperation between coworkers and customers”,,20/7/2018,,"Cons: The only drawback is that it cannot combine tasks assignments between projects. So, for users that have multiple tasks, it is now clear if they are available. However, Asana has released a video of their vision. This includes a complete view of a member of the company. So, if someone is caught up on a task on a specific day it is easily recognizable."
381,381 Asana,Asana,Brandon S.,Director of Product Performance,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Our Go-To for all communication and project management within our organization”,Overall: Organization of business and personal life Clearer and more involved communication on projects Templates and strategy outlines for projects,18/4/2018,"Pros: It replaces internal emails and keeps the team looped in, email just doesn't suffice when there are many moving parts. Everything you need for project management in one place. And Asana is always striving to make their product better by listening to their customers and imagining the future. I use this for organizing my personal life as well as my business life.","Cons: The product is simple to start and difficult to master. Someone new to the platform could easily be overwhelmed with the amount of capabilities. It would also be nice to be able to customize it a bit further to reflect our company, rather than feel like we have to go outside our company to communicate on projects. I have also not found any great resources on how to best organize everything so it looks clean and crisp."
382,382 Asana,Asana,C T.,,Machinery,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,“Surprisingly Awesome”,"Overall: I almost never give 5 star reviews but Asana definitely warrants this. I don't even have anything proper to complain about. It's easy to use with a very simple interface, but still contains everything you need (or a good workaround). Customer support reply VERY quickly, even to web enquiries. It's not terribly cheap but it's totally worth it for an enterprise account. I got into using it through work but I now have a personal workspace too and use that for everything from renovation budgets to grocery shopping lists. It's extremely versatile. I would definitely recommend it.",3/11/2016,"Pros: Easy to use, simple interface, very versatile, not buggy, pleasing design, TAB+B, other useful keyboards short-cuts, celebration unicorns (and narwhals and phoenixes), subtasks, easy and logical dependancies ('mark as waiting on')... I could go on and on.","Cons: Honeslty, there's nothing I actively dislike. The main improvement I can think of would be popup notifications for PC. But lacking it isn't exactly a con. Perhaps more customizable task views...?"
383,383 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Best Productivity Manager”,"Overall: I've experimented with a number of productivity tools in the past few years, but Asana is my favorite. It has an easy to learn interface, a very robust free version, the ability to share or keep private any given task or project. We use this to direct the development of training materials for two different software products, makes it very easy to see each product line on it's own, and internal message tags make it easy to come up to speed and UNCLOG EMAIL INBOXES. We spend less time reading random emails, digging out the context somewhere else, then doubling back to email to respond. The info and the context are in the same space. Love it.",3/8/2016,"Pros: Color tagging, embedded lists, and attaching a task to more than one project saves tons of time. Can tell at a glance what I am looking at, and see relevant info with a quick click. Also? I positively adore that magical unicorn that streaks across my screen when I complete a task. Not kidding.","Cons: Wish list for productivity apps is a mind map sort of screen, Asana doesn't have one, but neither do any of the others I tested, so it can hardly be considered a con"
384,384 Asana,Asana,Ethan M.,Designer,Design,2+ years,4,5,4,3,4,7,“Epic Collaboration platform makes Team management easy”,"Overall: Asana has brought many people into the sphere of my teams in the past, and being involved with various teams, I have built quite a bit using this platform and my teammates. It's feature rich interface has made building team projects enjoyable because of the neatness, file attachments and project specific notes. Delegating people to specific projects so they can collaborate and complete said project is a great feature considering everything is well organized and teammates can comment and construct projects, sub-projects, and campaigns quite well. A big or proficient team can compile data very quickly with the platform itself.",13/11/2020,"Pros: Asana has a very compatible and feature rich team building platform, which makes it very easy to delegate, build, and complete projects while keeping many of the individual notes and aspects of their construction organized nicely. This makes it easy for teams and organizations to operate in a manner where people can sign into Asana and collaborate in a proficient and effective way that can take projects to the next level and increase their value and overall meaning","Cons: Although the platform has served me quite well, sometimes it had been hard to enroll everyone into working with the platform. If people are not engaged with the platform or projects enthusiasm about the platform might not last that long, though better projects and management may solve these issues."
385,385 Asana,Asana,Jason C.,Continuous Improvement,Construction,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,8,“Boards and lists”,Overall: I enjoy using Asana. It keeps my teams on track and allows me to manage and prioritize upcoming tasks,28/9/2020,Pros: I like how easy it is to make boards and lists with Asana. I am able to convert one to the other so it makes it easier to change based on how the project is moving.,Cons: The app for Asana has formatting issues. I use deep subtasks that need to be opened to complete. The iPad app could be improved for this.
386,386 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Education Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Great task manager for Team Management”,"Overall: It has been great. I use Asana with my Technology Team, and we have a better understanding of what we need to cover during the day and the week.",22/9/2020,"Pros: The UX is the easiest I have tested before. No matter if you are on the desktop or on that mobile app, everything is built thinking on the users.","Cons: I would like to have more premium features on the free tier, like the Company management with letting add or delete users from the company."
387,387 Asana,Asana,Chris J.,Digital Demand Generation Manager,Human Resources,2+ years,4,5,4,,,8,“Great task management and collaboration software!”,Overall: We needed a project management tool that had integrations with other software we use. Asana fit the bill for this.,15/9/2020,"Pros: I love the collaboration capabilities of Asana. I'm able to easily see comments and communicate with others. The beauty of this is it is all tracked in the project. This means we can reference our conversation at anytime. I also love how we can keep track of tasks across multiple projects. I'm able to prioritize my tasks and quickly see them in the My Tasks section on my account. I also like how projects are built into portfolios. This allows me to quickly see all of the projects that similar to each other. Finally, being able to post status updates to both the project and portfolios helps me with keeping track of everything I've been doing.",Cons: While the communication is great it can be overwhelming if you are part of too many projects. If you are added as a collaborator to a task then you see all of the comments on that task whether they are addressed to you or not. This can cause some confusion because it is an overload of information and can be distracting to your workflow.
388,388 Asana,Asana,Christopher F. A.,President & Founder,Computer Games,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Excellent for agile development”,Overall: Very pleasant. I'm happy to be using this in our software stack and at the moment I wouldn't switch it out for anything.,3/9/2020,"Pros: This was one of the cheaper solutions out there for our small indie development team. We use it to plan multiple sprints for areas of development and also keep a master one for our project. It helps keeps us all on track and easy to share all the necessary information on the tasks themselves. Integration with Slack is excellent and you can tie it to channels and users, making it even easier to use and integrate with our workflows.",Cons: The pricing tiers kinda go from 0 to 100 quickly. And by that I mean it leaves small company friendly pricing to more startup funded costs. That's to be expected of a powerful software like this and no one else does it like them.
389,389 Asana,Asana,ERIC L.,Head of IT,Computer & Network Security,2+ years,5,5,5,3,5,10,“Great for Project Management”,Overall: We have used this for large complex projects and for day to day tasks. Works well with both.,24/8/2020,Pros: Easy to use project management software which is great for collaboration purposes. Easy to add files to tasks as well.,"Cons: Customer tech support is absolutely horrible. No phone # to call anyone, chat is always not available, so you have to use email only for communications. Not acceptable for when critical issues occur."
390,390 Asana,Asana,Marcelo G.,Data Analytics Technician,Chemicals,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Super useful even on free Version”,Overall: I use it to organize my projects and share progress with my co workers and managers.,21/7/2020,Pros: Super easy to use and help you and your team get organized with your projects. The graphic interface is very intuitive and also you can connect it with many other apps and software.,Cons: It would be great to add some features to enforce fields inputs.
391,391 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,4,3,3,8,“Powerful Task Management”,"Overall: A product you would definitely like to use freemium for keeping track of all tasks easily, If can afford Pro go for it, lot of features like dependencies and multi project assignments",23/6/2020,Pros: Lot of features to setup tasks and assign them properly. Easy to understand for anyone. Has extension on chrome to add tasks from anywhere. Freemium,Cons: Not many so far apart from: Lot of features are paid so not used those ones. Extension can be even more powerful
392,392 Asana,Asana,Josh H.,Student Pastor,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,“Asana Review”,Overall:,9/4/2020,Pros: The ability to seamlessly communicate via email or within the app is one of the best features of this platform. Our team can coordinate on a project board with simple and streamlined communication thanks to the simple accessibility and easy to navigate software.,"Cons: The app takes some getting used to, with the level of organization you can achieve, some things can get buried under layers of categorization, this can be mitigated with clear identification. Additionally with ongoing use of the app and growing familiarity with its interface one can easily overcome this."
393,393 Asana,Asana,Adiola C.,Accounts Clerk,Farming,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,8,“Asana - good for project and team management”,"Overall: Asana is the best way to organise my tasks and share project status with colleagues and superiors, although it can be overwhelming to set up , it is absolutely worth it. It enables me to use it either on my desktop or my mobile.",2/4/2020,"Pros: Asana is a very convenient software , it offers a number of functions and has ability to integrate other applications and services within it making it very convenient and versatile once you customise it to meet all your needs. Asana enables users to share tasks with others. Asana is a great deal in organising my tasks either by project or by client , it gives the benefit of customising my tasks in a way that is easy and convenient making my work organisation very easy and fast. Asana is very user friendly with excellent reliability and ease of use.","Cons: However , Asana requires a significant time commitment to grasp every facet of the application. Asana can also be time consuming in setting up ideal layout and structure for use for your team because of it's endless functional tools. Overally, Asana is a very useful software."
394,394 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Sporting Goods,2+ years,5,5,4,,,10,“Asana Does Exactly What you Want it to and More”,Overall: We love Asana. It has really made our day to day office life much easier. Communication is fully transparent between all team members regardless of where they are located.,5/3/2020,"Pros: Like the title says, Asana does exactly what we want it to do and offers a lot more. We started using Asana because we have team members across the world working at different time and this has allowed everyone to stay on top of what is going on. With just a quick glance, we are all able to see what the current status is of a project. Previously we relied on emails and messaging, but that can obviously be slow when dealing with people that are asleep on the other side of the world. Asana has streamlined our global offices.","Cons: We use most of the standard functionality, which is great, but there are other options available for purchase. It would be great to have access to these for free, but sadly they are not."
395,395 Asana,Asana,Kent B.,VP - Customer Service,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,2,1,2,5,“Great Customer Interface -- Awful Backend Support”,"Overall: Solid UI tool, horrible admin tools and no real ability to get the help you would expect from an enterprise tool.",18/2/2020,Pros: The software is great at working a project with multiple teams in different locations. We use it with our customers as we onboard them on our software and they always speak highly of the tool.,"Cons: First, there is no decent reporting or a realistic way of getting actionable data across projects. Second, when you try to reach out to learn more about what options you do have they will largely ignore your requests and do nothing."
396,396 Asana,Asana,Dani P.,Director of Client Success,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Efficient Project Management System! ”,Overall: I really love the accountability and organizational aspects of Asana. For project & client management this has been a HUGE streamlining tool as we've grown. We continue to encourage our employees to love Asana so that we can be efficient & timely with all of our client deliverables & internal tasks.,10/12/2019,Pros: I LIVE out of Asana. Asana is used across every single client at our agency and allows us to streamline deliverables with clearly outlined due dates & assignees. I also love that there is an element of ownership with tasks so that there is a paper trail of who has completed what and in what time frame. I also use Asana for my personal tasks as well to hold me accountable and keep me organized & prioritized throughout the day,"Cons: I don't care for the Asana update. It definitely makes it harder to quickly get details on the task details, however, I'm sure that they will continue iterating with each update."
397,397 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Government Administration,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Keeps me on track and sane”,Overall: Highly recommend Asana whether you have a team of 1 or 100.,24/10/2019,"Pros: Asana is beautiful, easy to use, and feature rich. It makes it easy for me to manage myself and my team - deadlines, projects, priority levels, automations, everything is easier.","Cons: Some of the best features are paid - from a business perspective, it makes sense. But if you're a small team it makes your barrier to entry a little tougher."
398,398 Asana,Asana,Henry E.,Investor,Real Estate,2+ years,4,3,4,,3,6,"“I like Asana, but we found better options for our use case”","Overall: Solving the communication issue with a team in separate locations, and everything all in one place tracked without having to rely on email.",13/9/2019,"Pros: I like the fact that you can view your data in multiple ways. Since they added the 'cards' view like Trello, its now more visual as well. We found a good Asana consultant from his YouTube videos who helped us get it all setup and dialed in","Cons: Honestly, I can't stand that they keep their logo on the top left - you can't customize that! inside of Wrike, the first thing we did is put our own logo up there vs. the vendor's logo. It's a little thing but really was irksome."
399,399 Asana,Asana,David R.,Site Reliability Engineer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,,7,“Great for allocating resources/people to projects across remote teams”,"Overall: Working in a 24 hour web hosting support operation, we've found Asana really helpful with handing off tasks across different timezones. We also like the ability to comment on tasks, these associated notifications and the ability to enter in larger projects, break them into sub tasks and the ability to schedule items at regular intervals.",27/8/2019,"Pros: We use Asana to allocate tasks across remote teams. Some tasks are regular tasks that we keep a regular thread about and other tasks are handed across timezones so the next shift can see what has been completed and work on the outstanding tasks. Our manager also uses this to summarize information from their shift and from other in-office meetings, so remote staff get a good summary and start to their shifts.","Cons: Sometimes the notifications on tasks/subtasks can be a little confusing. If you comment on a sub-task within Asana and close out the parent tasks, it can be difficult for other members associated with the task to get in and make comments on that task. This is more of a minor edge case though and potentially related to how we are using the product."
400,400 Asana,Asana,Ryan J.,Director of IT,Food & Beverages,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,“Great Simple Project Management”,Overall: Asana helps keep everyone organized. It's a central platform where we can see the progress of all projects and also discuss individual tasks publicly.,20/8/2019,Pros: Asana is extremely easy to use and they release new features regularly. We needed something to keep our projects organized and this fit the bill. The integration with Outlook helps as well.,"Cons: It isn't exactly cheap. Like many others, they have a per user monthly fee. This just adds up quickly."
401,401 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“Asana Review ”,"Overall: My personal experience with Asana was a user as an advisor. I was advising a variety of people at a time along with having internal tasks that required me to complete a variety of tasks. I utilized Asana in creating tasks for myself regarding internal tasks, people facing tasks, along with receiving tasks from my superiors regarding specific people or various internal tasks. Asana made it easy to understand and use when attempting to manage and remember a variety of tasks.",19/8/2019,"Pros: When Using Asana, it is extremely fun and easy to use. It makes the experience of task management enjoyable and fun to work with. It is clear and concise and easy to understand. It is not hard to figure out and is also a task management tool that is easy to teach to other users. It is useful for many different organizational styles along with different types of task groups.",Cons: I personally did not have any major issues with Asana. I thought that the only major con was that sometimes there were additional details I wished I could add or separate out into additional groups within a task but beyond that I didn't have any issues personally with Asana.
402,402 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Simplified Sprints & Product Management”,Overall: Asana simplified our product management and task management. We switched from using Trello and our team was much more independent after switching.,12/8/2019,"Pros: Asana helped our team get organized. Instead of having lengthy sprint planning and sprint review sessions, Asana made it easier to get the information we needed organized. It also made our team much more accountable for their individual tasks.","Cons: We needed to create a workaround for attaching cards and bugs to distinct customers. It's all possible with tags and with hashtags if needed. I would like a view to show cards & bugs by customers, it helps with account management."
403,403 Asana,Asana,Sergio O.,Sales,International Trade and Development,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“State of the art software”,"Overall: Excellent experience. I use Asana everyday of my life to organize my work, my taska and everything",30/7/2019,"Pros: I use it every day of my life. It's smooth, fast, reliable, easy, clean.",Cons: That I have to pay to have some premium features. But I wouldn't understand how they can work so hard without charging for it.
404,404 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Graphic Design,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,“Best way to organize and schedule your work”,"Overall: Asana helped my company understand how fundamental it is to have our project deeply scheduled, it allowed our team an easy way to understand the project status at any phase and overal made our communication way better",27/5/2019,Pros: The best features are the timeline view of each project which helps you understand the progression,Cons: Overall THIS is currently the best of its kind however I would like some more advanced features and customization. Also I would love if they could make a feature to change the image of each project
405,405 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,3,,4,6,“Relatively Easy Project Management Software”,"Overall: I've been both an individual contributor and a manager. In both roles, visibility to my team and other teams has been vital. Like I mentioned above, Asana is really great at providing that visibility within and across teams. It's been a sufficient tool for us in managing tasks assigned by one user to another user, as well as OK at managing linear workflows for various departments.",10/4/2019,"Pros: The best thing about Asana for our company is the visibility to departmental priorities, projects and tasks across the entire company. Having a single place to see these tasks is really great for accountability and for others to help out if necessary.","Cons: There are features that would help maintain consistent processes but they are only available at the higher-tier plans which make the lower-tier plans not much more than fancy to-do lists. If they rolled some of those features (example: forms) to the lower-tier plan, it would be a much more effective tool at that price point."
406,406 Asana,Asana,Josemaria G.,Vice Director for External Affairs,E-Learning,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,“For Work and Persional Passion Projects”,,3/4/2019,,Cons: Just a few instances when I have noticed delays in loading the main dashboard or home screen. So far no problems with using the smartphone app.
407,407 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Best project management tool for small teams”,Overall: Easy to use and easy to set up. The tool is so flexible to multiple project management styles and a pleasure to use. Asana listens to customer feedback and has a robust forum to ask questions.,26/3/2019,"Pros: I love how with the premium version you can take advantage of the timeline feature. The templates are awesome, the flexibility of the software is amazing. I have integration set up to help me measure my work and productivity, as well as create entire projects from a template when new work comes in. A big point of note is how easy it is for someone to come in and start using this software. When there are millions of options out there for project collaboration, you need to be able to confidently jump in and onboard clients. This tool does that. I appreciate that Asana has documented everything so clearly and with such a clean interface. It's make my small business possible.",Cons: I wish it was possible to change a board to a list. It would also be nice if a lighter version of the premium plan existed -- something with just the timeline feature.
408,408 Asana,Asana,Adelaide A.,Chief Operations Officer,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Asana is the backbone of our business”,,21/3/2019,,"Cons: I wish there were more task views. Sometimes it's hard to find tasks that are buried within tasks. I also wish there was a better way to label and organize teams on the sidebar. Since we serve multiple clients and have multiple internal projects going at once, we have to get creative with how we label teams to get them categorized correctly on the sidebar. I can imagine that if you had tons of clients, the sidebar would get confusing and overwhelming pretty quickly."
409,409 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,4,,,7,“Great Collaborative Project Management Software”,"Overall: I began using Asana a few years ago when I started with my current company. I have found that it does have a lot of great features but there is a big learning curve and it's not as intuitive as I would like. There are many times I find myself frustrated because Asana doesn't do quite what I would like it to. However, as a whole I think it's a successful project management option and does have far more pros than cons.",20/1/2019,Pros: Asana allows a team to work together and communicate to manage multiple projects at the same time. I like the ability to create a project for a client and then make various tasks for different work that needs to be done. Subtasks can be created and everything can have different dates and people who it have been assigned to.,Cons: There is an issue with creating recurring tasks with subtasks. This is very inconvenient when I want to have a recurring task's subtask have a different date. I end up with multiple items showing up in my tasks.
410,410 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Internet,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,9,“Great for Every Agency”,"Overall: Asana is a platform that is being used throughout our company for many years now. It makes the life of a project manager a lot easier and allows us to take control of projects and activities, it allows us to communicate to the various teams in different countries in an easy way.",20/12/2018,"Pros: We have offices in other countries and communication is always a challenge. Asana makes the information transparent and accessible to everyone in the company. It's easy add our clients to Asana and still control the flow. Being able to link to external link for InVision prototypes or proto.io is a huge time saver. Slack is a great addition, it makes much of the communication automatic.",Cons: As there are a lot of features it can be sometimes confusing and even tho there is a search it can still be challenging to find the information. Tasks added by email integration should be allowed to be assigned to specific project sections to minimize admin work.
411,411 Asana,Asana,Joshua B.,Videographer - Joshua Buckles Media & Freelance,Religious Institutions,2+ years,4,4,4,,5,8,“Great Tool For Teams and Businesses”,"Overall: It's been a great tool for the teams where I work. Anytime we have something that needs to be done, it immediately gets put into a project for review, and then listed in another project once it has been reviewed and discussed with our team. It has been an absolute great organizer.",11/9/2018,"Pros: The functionality of Asana allows teams and businesses to quickly and easily make projects, assign tasks, and add comments and subtasks. It allows teams to see the status of projects easily, set due dates, and add descriptions so that projects aren't bogged down. It's extremely easy to get around in Asana with a very low learning curve, allowing virtually anyone to get a grasp of the tool within minutes.","Cons: It can be a little clunky at times, and if not careful when cross-listing tasks across multiple projects, tasks can easily get misplaced. Sometimes it would be nice to be able to add more than one person to a task, instead of just following a task."
412,412 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,9,“Asana is the best tool to help you organize your work tasks!”,Overall:,10/9/2018,"Pros: Asana is the best tool out there to help you organize everything you use at work - from email, sticky notes, project management and spreadsheets! It helps me collaborate with my team, and it greatly eliminated the need for us to have multiple spreadsheet, sticky notes, and a lot of paper trail! It is a great project management tool that harbors collaboration within the team, and also to help everyone in our office in managing all the tasks that we need to do everyday! No responsibilities to forget anymore",Cons: The only thing that Asana is missing is that I am unable to categorize the tasks assigned. I hope they can provide like a note tiering or color scheme tiering so that my team members will know if the tasks is the most important task for the day or if the task is least important that you can do it towards EOD.
413,413 Asana,Asana,Kelly E.,Chief Operations Officer,Accounting,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“One of the Best Apps in our Business.”,,19/7/2018,,"Cons: I don't really have anything bad to say about Asana, I only wish I knew about it sooner as it has changed my life."
414,414 Asana,Asana,John H.,Website Manager,Computer Networking,2+ years,4,5,4,5,5,8,“User friendly -- great functionality with free version”,Overall: The ability to communicate tasks effectively with my team is second to none. Everything can get laid out in different phases with tasks assigned to each team member with a due date. Having everyone on the same page and having project conversations right within Asana ensures we never miss a beat.,7/5/2018,"Pros: The ability to assign tasks to different people with a due date attached is by far the best feature. Having the ability for everyone to see the tasks on a project board, give notes, and update team on the status is wonderful. Having a team chat and create different organizations with different levels of access is nice as well. The ability to have different work spaces is great when you need people to separate out your projects with different companies.",Cons: Lack of custom fields in free version is hindering somewhat. I also find that I dislike when you actually complete a task that it goes away. You have to go hunting for your archived tasks. It would be better if they were just marked out or put in an easy to find archive area that stayed with whatever the project was.
415,415 Asana,Asana,Josh G.,Account-Based Marketing Specialist,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,“Simple project management software that's easy to pick-up and go.”,"Overall: I've been able to brain dump in a way, everything that I'm working on. It allows me to put any idea or task into some program that I can reference later. It's been a huge help for my work life and even some of my personal life tasks that can overwhelm me.",25/4/2018,"Pros: The interface is simple to use Timeline feature is awesome Being able to choose from different project management styles (board, timeline, calendar, or lists) Followers feature to track the progress of a task No matter how many projects you're a part of, you can view all of them in your My Tasks area, which is huge! It can get overwhelming but I usually ease that by going to My Tasks then filtering by due date and incomplete tasks.","Cons: To close the side panel you have to click the X by their logo, which is not intuitive Can't assign a task to multiple people Top nav is too small for my preference. The My Tasks and Inbox area is so small and I would like it to be more prominent. My Tasks should to filtered by Due Date and Incomplete as the default but I wish you could save a preference. It can be a little cumbersome to do it every time."
416,416 Asana,Asana,Josh C.,Multimedia Design & Project Manager,11-50 employees,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,8,“Asana: Awesome Free Tool with Killer Premium Options”,"Overall: Asana is very thoughfully designed and is the most useful and usable project management software I've used, full stop. I've used several that are MUCH more expensive, but only filled niche needs that Asana couldn't. If you're looking for the best general-purpose project management tool around, Asana's for you. Their new business tactic seems to be to add all new features to their premium offering. They used to offer new features to free users, but it's been a while since that has happened. Their free version is very full-featured and usable, but it'd be nice to see some of their development time go towards expanding that product's capabilities.",8/3/2018,"Pros: Asana gives you a ton of functionality for free. Most small teams with relatively simple workflows will find it to be fully featured without ever having to pay anything. However, they offer several features for a fee (larger teams, dependent tasks and custom fields are big ones) that offer additional and truly useful functionality if you're willing to pay.",
417,417 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,51-200 employees,2+ years,4,4,5,,,8,“A great tool for keeping our marketing team organized”,Overall: Accountability and transparency. Boom.,7/3/2018,"Pros: I love how dynamic each task can be. I love that I can include subtasks, attachments and tags to each task, set due dates and priorities for individual tasks and have conversations. I also appreciate that it saves unsent comments when you navigate away from the page. I've often got distracted and left the platform and relieved to find that what I'd been in the middle of typing was still there. I don't know that I have much to compare it to but it's a really handy tool that we use to keep ourselves accountable and other stakeholders in the loop.","Cons: The most annoying thing I've encountered has to to with recurring tasks. It seems as though recurring tasks show up X amount of time after the task is completed, rather than when you want it to happen. So if something is supposed to happen every Tuesday but, one week, the task isn't actually marked complete until Thursday, the task will then populate the next week as due on Thursday. I admittedly haven't looked into a solution for this."
418,418 Asana,Asana,Amy P.,Bookkeeper,Accounting,2+ years,4,5,3,,4,8,“Extremely user-friendly with basic project management functionality”,"Overall: It's a good app, and there are more integrations to the other tools you use every day. I think it's going to become a really excellent, intuitive project management solution.",16/1/2018,"Pros: You can create your Asana account and begin using it with almost no setup. It's simple, straightforward project management software. For us this was critical because we looked at a bunch of other applications that had more functionality but we knew we'd never actually take the time to sit down and build our practice around them. We can collaborate and assign each other tasks in Asana, set tasks as recurring, and set up task dependencies. Creating new projects and adding tasks to them is really easy. I'm happy with it overall. Also - a lot of other web-based applications are starting to build Asana integrations now, so I am excited about where it's going","Cons: It's not quite as flexible as I'd like it to be, but we are able to make it work. I wish you could see sub-tasks displayed in the project's task list, and wish there were more options for how to display your tasks in the ""My Tasks"" list. It would also be nice to be able to create project templates, but we kind of have to rig that right now by creating dummy projects."
419,419 Asana,Asana,Tee B.,Executive Director of Development,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,4,3,2,8,"“Asana is my organization's choice, but functionality could certainly be improved”",Overall: Already mentioned in the section about what I liked about the product. It's been a principle source of organization and ordering for my team.,12/10/2017,"Pros: - Recurring tasks have been quite important for us - Being able to use color-coded custom tags is fantastic - Answering comments through email has been helpful before, as has being able to click on the task in email and get taken directly to the task - Getting an email for someone liking a task seems like an unnecessary standard setting - I enjoyed receiving emails with tips on how to use Asana, not just new features","Cons: - Boards can only be used in project view and not on a variety of views - Paid version at something like $5 a user beyond the capacity of non-profits/smaller orgs - Cannot revert workspace to personal once accidentally changed to domain team - Should be able to adjust notifications for people who are 'following'. Maybe I don't necessarily want them to be bothered about it, but still show up on their Asana dashboard - Easier integration into Slack would be great for the creation of tasks on the go"
420,420 Asana,Asana,Kyla O.,Business Owner,Retail,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Great for Project Management!”,Overall: It's such a great visual way to track my workflow. I also love that I can take it on the go and check it anywhere,20/7/2017,"Pros: Asana offers a clean and intuitive platform for managing projects. I use it for daily to dos and long-term projects. They recently introduced the board layout for projects and I LOVE it! Visually, it totally works for me when I'm launching my new projects. In this view, I can easily drag and drop tasks within columns and adjust due dates as necessary. It's also a great tool for creating a template for repeating projects. You can easily duplicate all of the tasks and then edit the details and due dates. I also love the unicorn celebrations when you mark a task done.",Cons: Just a few small things: Deleting tasks is a little clunky and I can never remember what the keyboard shortcut is. I also wish you could quickly mark a task done in the board layout without opening the task window.
421,421 Asana,Asana,Daniel A.,Application Engineer,Environmental Services,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,9,“Definitely Easy to Master and Collaboration Without Email is so True!”,"Overall: A colleague and i started using this a few years ago at work because we went from MS to Google for work email and workflow. MS had outlook and Google has no task manager so we tried 10-12 different task management apps. Asana was by far the easiest to master in a short time and its simplicity is what makes it powerful. Easy navigation, simple yet powerful, and integrating with Google has been seamless. I hope Google purchases Asana or something close to that so we can fully go ""all in"". We are in the free version now but hope to maybe step up our game and try the premium version to see its full potential.",27/4/2017,"Pros: Easy to master, simple, visually easy on the eyes, powerful and not overdone, integration with Google and Instagantt, free version is powerful enough to test before investing in premium version.",Cons: No integral Gantt charts. Growing it to a full project management software would help.
422,422 Asana,Asana,David B.,Communications Director,Civic & Social Organization,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,10,“Productivity that grows with our company”,"Overall: Our staff has more than doubled since we started using Asana and as we grow we need tools to make sure our collaboration doesn't drop. The practices we started when we could all meet twice a week are scaled by using templates and creating recurring tasks for all of our systems from meetings, to project management, to hiring and onboarding new staff. It was incredibly easy to transition to a paid plan (we started with the free version) and as more features roll out, they are often incorporated immediately! We love to try out new tools and Asana is one that has stuck with us, making our work and teams stronger.",6/12/2016,"Pros: Easy to share and collaborate, delightfully designed, more functionality than we've maximized which makes it feel deep and broad","Cons: When you get a lot of tasks in a project, it's easy to be overwhelmed visually and sometimes difficult to sort. Good planning and reflection time solves this but if you're moving fast you can end up with a mess!"
423,423 Asana,Asana,Alec P.,Product Marketing Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“The best team organizing tool around”,"Overall: Our company uses this tool across our organization with the top users coming from Marketing, Product, Customer Success and Sales & Marketing Operations. It's a great tool for cross-organizational visibility as well as productivity. With it's fairly flexible interface and myriad features for customizing project-based or personal tasks Asana does what many other tools wish they could: align and organize. We use the Project-based system extensively for personal tasks (as opposed to the My Tasks view) because of the flexibility of Asana to help us with OKR, goal setting and discussions. We also use the API to integrate creative brief requests into our workflow. Asana has allowed us to better align our teams. Within the Marketing team we are constantly communicating via the per-task comment system and @ mentions. I'm currently experimenting with OKR-style projects to further extend our goals.",6/9/2016,Pros: + Flexibility of task creation/management + Ease of use day-to-day + Integrations + Support from Asana,Cons: - You may have to bend your project organization to fit the hierarchical structure

It also had an easy to understand user interface. The integrations with other apps worked well.",Cons: There were some key features that I was used to using in similar software products that this did not have. Some of the key customisation features were something that had to be paid for or was not available.
425,425 Asana,Asana,Olivia S.,Web Designer,Design,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,"“Great, Powerful Task Manager”","Overall: My overall experience is great. I'm very pleased with how powerful it is as a task manager, and how powerful it can be as a collaboration tool.",6/10/2020,"Pros: This software is easy and intuitive to use from the get-go. It allows you to see products from a couple of different vantage points, and is easy to customize to your distinct needs.","Cons: One of the mildly annoying things is that you need to duplicate a task if you want two people assigned to it, rather than add them to one task. It's a little annoying when you're looking over the steps of a project, but not a dealbreaker by any means."
426,426 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,5,5,5,3,10,“Asana is my go-to tool”,Overall: Amazing,19/6/2020,"Pros: Asana is an amazing piece of software and is getting better by the days. I enjoy the level of involvement they have with users such as myself as we are able to interact with people inside the company. They are proactive with constant webinars, via Slack, and email.",Cons: I haven't found none so far. Maybe if suntan could have a better visualization on List view.
427,427 Asana,Asana,Stephen Brent M.,Founder,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,3,2,2,4,"“Great features, poor pricing model”",,13/6/2020,,"Cons: We started with a free plan, but when we needed to scale, the pricing model was bad for our use case. We only had 3 users at the time but were required to pay for 5 regardless of whether we used the additional licenses or not. This ultimately led to us not using the software. I would rather pay for what I need and not waste spend on things I am not using."
428,428 Asana,Asana,Barbara C.,Customer Service Manager,Food & Beverages,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,8,“We use it to order and plan weekly work”,Overall: We use Asana to design and compose a spread of activities. this is frequently incredible for assisting with remaining sorted out and mapping out undertakings and thusly the status of changed errands. It additionally has some savvy highlights like moving an assignment once it's checked finished. I'm utilizing it for private and expert ventures and that I see the contrast between utilizing the application and utilizing a paper schedule.,4/6/2020,"Pros: A down to earth on account of timetable and screen undertakings and dole out them. I truly like how we will move errands around and alter them with records, pictures, notes, and remarks. The apparatus is regularly used in close to home and expert activities. My efficiency and subsequently the profitability of my group have expanded tons since I began utilizing this instrument.",Cons: Not certain what Asana can do to change this. I simply wish all our colleagues are regularly ready on all occasions. It is frequently hard for each colleague to shape sure that finished errands are set apart as complete or for them to remember to refresh the assignments.
429,429 Asana,Asana,Linda E.,Human Resources Manager,Retail,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,8,“The use of Asana has been fundamental in our team”,"Overall: Without Asana, our groups would spend far an unnecessary measure of time burrowing through messages to ask information and making important calls. Asana spares us time and makes our lives simpler. Asana is critical for groups to stay on a proportionate page and for a proficient work process to happen.",6/4/2020,"Pros: I truly like this application, it's permitted us to be in contact with our whole group. Asana is that the ideal stage to clearly and just observe different floods of ventures and timetables of assignments for all clients, interfacing everybody to in any event one spot where coordinated effort can occur progressively.","Cons: The main grievance I can consider that I even have experienced when utilizing Asana needs to sign in much of the time which can disturb changes that I make over the span of every day. As it were, there are times where I even have been effectively refreshing a task and gratitude to latency."
430,430 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,"“Get Organized, Manage through Asana ”",Overall: I love Asana. The ease that it gives and the coordination it provides the users it simply mind boggling. Teams can work effectively when using this tool,13/3/2020,Pros: I love Asana for the following factors- Ease of usage Setting up priorities and deadlines was never this easy Sharing details and assigning tasks is as simple as could be. One of the best project management tools I have ever used Its mobile app is also superb and est to use. Brings everyone on the team on the same page without meetings and conferences,"Cons: The only thing I feel lacks is the performance of the requests that have been completed. If you can cater that, this will be a flawless tool to be used."
431,431 Asana,Asana,Anieka J.,Program Manager,Education Management,2+ years,4,2,4,,,2,"“It was fine, but just wasn't that helpful in the end”","Overall: If only Asana would have made those changes sooner, I probably would have made them my Centers main operations base, but Trello made it there faster. I would say that if I was starting out, that Asana is a MUCH closer competitor to Trello, but still has pockets of inconvenience that makes it harder less than ideal. But I would definitely you try it out before not considering it. Different strokes, for different folks. It's still a strong software, and could be perfect for you.",3/3/2020,Pros: I think I like that checklists feature the most. It made it pretty easy to set those up.,"Cons: While my favorite part were the checklists, I found it difficult to conceptualize where they ""fell"" in the grand scheme. You access a list of tasks, but that was very overwhelming for planners. It didn't group them my project or date. It just sorted it by date, which isn't as helpful to me. When I was using it, there wasn't a board feature, but it has that now, which would be more helpful. Trello had that feature then, not Asana, which is why I made the choice to use Trello vs Asana. My difficulty not being able to group my tasks more clearly was a BIG deal, but you can do that now, and the interface looks really nice. The only downside is that it would be nice to see a calendar with my tasks like how Trello has. I also don't see how you can view all projects in one place. Maybe that's because that's power of Planyway with Trello. That's a big drawback for me too."
432,432 Asana,Asana,Todd K.,Content Director,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,3,4,,,7,“It Helps Move the Needle”,Overall:,3/2/2020,"Pros: I appreciate being able to track deadlines and multiple tasks within a project. Asana allows for a very macro to very micro level of detail when working with a team on a project, it just depends on what the need is. The developer is also always rolling out new features to keep up with customer needs.","Cons: It can get confusing if a project has a lot of moving parts. There are plenty of category filters and tags you can use, but keeping things consistent for all users can be difficult. The interface could use a bit more streamlining to see a project from start to finish, as well as status updates."
433,433 Asana,Asana,Federico P.,IT Specialist,Machinery,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,7,"“Work management, not project management software”","Overall: Very good, it really helped a lot our team work, we don't miss any task at all",7/1/2020,Pros: Asana is a great way to help you split your tasks in smaller tasks to an indefinite number of levels and keeping tracks of the results,Cons: It lacks of the ability to see the percentage of the overall subtasks from tht parent task. It would be cool to see the value from the parent task instead of digging into the subtasks to find out
434,434 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Government Administration,2+ years,4,5,4,4,4,9,“Project management made easy”,Overall: Easy management of teams localized in diferente places.,3/1/2020,Pros: Easy learn curve. Simple and efective. The fact that we can mix document types and link them to external localizations.,Cons: It will be nice if we have a search tool to find some task in all of our projects. The price is a little bit expensive.
435,435 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,"“Intuitive, easy, responsive service”","Overall: I use Asana as a marketing team project management tool and as an editorial calendar for content planning, creation, and distribution.",5/12/2019,"Pros: It's just so easy to use, and this might sound strange, but nobody hates it. Project management tools can be polarizing, but I've used Asana across a few different companies, and it's the one tool that nobody complains about. There may be more specialized tools out there, or more powerful ones, but Asana is a crowd-pleaser. It gets the job done, facilitates better teamwork, and keeps everyone organized. I'm a fan","Cons: I've had a hard time integrating certain Google products because my company has a bit of a complex domain/alias situation. But when I've had to ask for help, I've gotten prompt responses, even if they haven't always been able to solve the underlying problem (probably because it's not theirs to solve)."
436,436 Asana,Asana,Alberto O.,Founder,E-Learning,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Our Remote Team Can't Live Without It!”,Overall: Asana has allowed everyone in our team to take responsibility and accountability for their jobs and functions in a completely intuitive way. It allows everyone to have full visibility of their current and upcoming work. It truly takes project management to a whole other level and is a tool we can't live without.,3/12/2019,Pros: Asana has helped our team organize in so many ways. We are an entirely remote team based on all corners of the world and Asana allows us to stay on top of multiple projects at once. Asana can be divided by different teams and departments of an organization. The best part of all is that the free plan is completely functional on so many levels. We have yet to find a reason to upgrade.,Cons: Asana has very little to not like about it. If I were to say one thing we wish could improve is the ability for specific users such as managers can see a calendar from multiple teams instead of one calendar per team. I believe this a feature in the paid version.
437,437 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,8,“Good tool for large teams and project management”,Overall: Project management and cross-department collaboration. It's great for working with the creative department.,22/10/2019,Pros: This is a great resource for large teams overseeing a lot of projects. It's good for project level collaboration and sets cadences/milestones for all memebers.,Cons: Something about the user interface seems a bit much. It's easy to get very disorganized within the app if you aren't on-boarded properly.
438,438 Asana,Asana,Samantha H.,Associate Energy Engineer,Utilities,2+ years,5,5,3,,,8,“Great Software - but has it's drawbacks”,Overall:,17/10/2019,"Pros: The great thing about Asana is how organized it keeps everyone and it allows us to be able to track each and every task we might have to do. I also love the little features that makes Asana more enjoyable to use. The little celebrations you can get, or the fact that it can snow in the background or you can have Bats fly around with the different themes. It's the little things that makes Asana enjoyable day to day, especially since I'm constantly staring at it.","Cons: Sometimes it seems we have useless tasks, or that it just becomes an endless list of tasks that never ends. But that may be how we organize our tasks. I feel there are features that aren't well advertised that would be more beneficial for us and could be utilized more."
439,439 Asana,Asana,Brianne P.,Account Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,4,,,7,“Decent User Friendly Task Manager”,Overall:,15/10/2019,"Pros: I use this tool daily to manage my own tasks and also assign out tasks to my team. It is really nice that you can setup projects and templates. I also love how easy it is to create your own fields with colored visual indicators on picklists. Overall, easy to use tool that I would use more if it was more robust, but it works for simple stuff",Cons: Wish there was more of a project management side to this. The calendar views and Kanban views are kind of clunky and annoying to use.
440,440 Asana,Asana,Jonathan C.,VP Technology,Real Estate,2+ years,5,5,4,,4,8,“Project Management 101”,Overall: Useful for managing tasks across teams and keeps track of where you are and provides ample reminders.,24/9/2019,Pros: Easy to use and setup for initial use. Very helpful templates and the ability to clone and copy projects and tasks all in real-time.,"Cons: Could integrate with O365 better with email, files-haring, calendaring, and contacts. Not sure of its true PM capabilities as we mostly use it for project task management."
441,441 Asana,Asana,Alison A.,Business Development Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Great for Personal & Team Tasking”,"Overall: Asana helped solve some communication issues that we were having within our team. Being on a small team, with each individual team member wearing multiple hats it is critical to have a central repository for all things task-oriented. It keeps all of us on track & a more positive work environment where there is no passive aggressive asks re: old task... Asana does the reminding for you",24/9/2019,"Pros: I used Asana to keep track of my goals on a day-to-day basis at work. Working at a start-up, priorities can shift within the first 5 minutes of the workday, so staying organized is key! Asana helps to organize tasks & seeing everything in a calendar view helps keep projects on track. Who doesn't love checking off task after task throughout the day??","Cons: Nothing to complain about, love the software. The only thing that I would change is the ability to add more colors for various projects. We're tracking so much, we ran out of colors!"
442,442 Asana,Asana,Hada B.,Software Developer,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,4,4,4,9,“Powerful tool for the development of team business projects”,"Overall: Because it is a software that provides all the features for teamwork, implementing it has allowed us to improve our project management since the fact that we can assign both tasks and subtasks facilitates the development of each project and allows delivery for the expected time .",19/8/2019,"Pros: Asana is a tool that I like because it allows the business project management process to be carried out much more simply, since we can assign tasks to different workers and can place them on the deadline for delivery and in case of changes edit it, account With a control panel that is very intuitive and versatile so that any user can adapt to it easily, it has features that make workflow even easier since it allows you to attach files, receive notifications about all the generating changes in the projects so that we are all updated on them and the best thing is that it is a multiplatform software so it is not necessary to be in the office for its use and the advancement of our tasks.",Cons: This software is very complete and useful but the one that has so many functions more than simplifying the work can give more because many users are often confused as to what utility some functions have.
443,443 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Great Team Features”,"Overall: As a team, we're able to easily monitor progress and map out projects using Asana. We were looking for a tool that would allow us to see each other's workloads and share the projects according to strengths and priorities and Asana works a treat.",12/8/2019,Pros: Asana makes it easy to distribute and visualise to-do lists individually and within teams. The tool makes collaboration really simple.,Cons: It could be a little more fluid - sometimes there is a lot of clicking needed to move or redistribute tasks.
444,444 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,9,“This is a great tool for Team Collaboration”,,7/5/2019,,Cons: It would be more useful if the Team members would be able to communicate with Conference Video Calls and also it would be more Convention is there is Voice Messages that can be sent to the Team members and if the team members could easily comment on the tasks and have a quick chat on tasks it would be more useful. This enhances the communication system well and makes the collaboration in an effective manner.
445,445 Asana,Asana,Kristen C.,Director of Events & Content Marketing,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,4,,,9,“Full Visibility & Organization in One”,"Overall: Bottom line, it has organized our marketing team. We now have less meetings because we know what everyone is working on.",5/4/2019,"Pros: Asana was a life saver when our company rebranded last year. We were able to throw all our different department tasks on Asana to have full visibility into what still needed to be completed. Working with contractors, we were able to manage their time and understand where they have availability. The ability to have individual views of projects too is huge. Everyone's planning and organizational styles are different so it is nice that you can either choose to see your tasks in a calendar, board, list, timeline, etc.","Cons: We keep our communications and content calendar on Asana and I would like the ability to export it in the view that it has on Asana. While you have the option to export or print, it doesn't allow you to choose how it would look. Weacn give partners or vendors access to our platform, but sometimes just a viewable link or something to change into a PDF would be preferred."
446,446 Asana,Asana,Brittany H.,Web Coordinator,Higher Education,2+ years,4,3,4,,,6,“Deadline-Driven Project Management”,"Overall: One of my favorites for organizing tasks with due dates and assignees. Use this to break big projects down, but realize that it doesn't substitute for the project planning process. This is for implementing your plans, mainly driven by deadlines and involving multiple people.",2/4/2019,"Pros: There is a Kanban view for those who are used to boards and cards, but where this software really shines for me is in the task and calendar views. You can see what has already been done to verify progress or hide it to focus on the future. You can see what everyone is doing to manage the team or you can show just what you're responsible for to get your head in the game.","Cons: I had no problem grasping the program, but on my team, I estimate that 40% of them really struggled to get going with it. Sometimes it was the UI just not clicking for them, other times it was information overload. I wish there was a way to pre-filter the views for my team members so they don't get that overload (maybe there is and I missed it-which would be another negative that it wasn't easy for me to find)."
447,447 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,5,4,5,4,10,“Great for Visual Learners and Organizers”,"Overall: I would say that team members definitely benefit from Asana. I love that I can personalize and organize all of my tasks and projects in a way that is most efficient for me, but any coworker can also be a follower of a certain project, task, or group so each individual is on the same page and has equal access to everything.",7/2/2019,"Pros: As stated in the title, I am a very visual learner and a visual organizer as well. Being able to make projects, tasks for those projects, and subtasks for each task ensures that my coworkers and I are all on the same page. Because of this, everything is easily searchable as well. I also appreciate the fact that I have multiple options of which layout I'd like to view my projects in, whether it be the Board View or the List view, etc.","Cons: I have only come across a very select few bug issues while using this platform. For example, about a week ago I was trying to view one of my Projects and, while it would load completely in some formats, other formats would come up as blank - almost as if the page were loading. It also took me a long while to find even one contact email for customer service help, and rather than finding it on Asana's website, it was through Google searching and reading through the advice of others who had had the same problem of not being able to find a contact email for help. However, once I did find an email to contact for customer service, I got a response from a very kind and apologetic team member who notified Asana's tech team immediately so the bug was fixed and my Asana was up and running effectively by the next morning."
448,448 Asana,Asana,Mike W.,Managing Partner,Management Consulting,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,"“Asana keeps you organized and because you can delegate tasks, it helps get work done!”","Overall: We use ASANA as a team to manage repetitive tasks (book me as a speaker, set up a new consulting client, run a workshop, etc.) AND to handle ad hoc ideas and tasks (create content, do prospecting, follow-up on a lead, etc.). By assigning tasks to others on my team, I can free up my own time. ASANA lets me see how each team member is progressing as well--so I always know where every task is and I don't have to bother people with updates or requests for info.",4/12/2018,Pros: ASANA makes me more productive by helping me feel confident that big picture items and the details that support them don't fall through the cracks. It's kind of like a brand insurance policy as well as a project management system. The coolest feature of all is called MY TASKS. It lets me see all my tasks (ordered any way I like) across all projects. That's what makes this product much better (in my opinion) that others in its category.,"Cons: I rarely say this, but nothing. I've been a user for about two years. Back then, I had issues. Now, ASANA has solved them all and kept the product roadmap moving smartly forward."
449,449 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Education Management,2+ years,5,4,5,,5,10,“Asana is the go to management tool”,Overall: I am sad that it ended.,27/11/2018,"Pros: We recently moved from Asana and I miss it so much. In terms of performance, it excels. It's UX is super smooth, and although the software look complicated in the first moment, it sure worth the effort. The tool gave us the flexibility we need to work with Kanban and Sprints on a daily basis along with Projects. The Project Manager can control the flow of the tasks inside the Project, while the same task is added into the development team's Sprint and Kanban Board.","Cons: The ""Personal Projects"" sections looks like a separate app that didn't have some features added to it and it's deprecated. Even with Asana Premium on my organisation I didn't have some fundamental features on my Personal Projects area. I had to create a new organisation on a free tier to organize my personal life."
450,450 Asana,Asana,Andy B.,CEO,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,4,,4,8,“Great project management and team organization platform”,"Overall: When we launched our startup we were undecided between Asana and Trello, and gave both a shot. In the very beginning we went with Trello, as Asana had a steeper learning curve and we our needs were very simple. But very soon after we came back to Asana, as it allowed us to manage our projects and product development timeline in a more efficient way. Now that our team has grown beyond 15 people and we use Asana's paid service, we are considering whether the extra functionality Jira provides is worth the difference in price. That said, Asana has served us very well all of this time",28/9/2018,"Pros: Free for teams up to 15 people Many more features than Trello Allows management of semi-complex projects, with individual responsibilities, sub-tasks and deadlines",Cons: Certain functionalities (for example dependencies and timelines) are only available in the paid version Asana doesn't allow for the kind of complexity that Jira offers (although it is easier to use for what it offers)
451,451 Asana,Asana,Peter N.,Video Director,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,4,4,4,5,9,"“Great for bosses, managers, middle-men, and the rest of us.”","Overall: For what the program is, I have found it to be very useful and great value for improving productivity for individuals and collective teams within organizations.",6/9/2018,"Pros: Asana helps me keep track of multiple projects and tasks at the same time. It is a great substitution for a calendar with notes about various due dates, as well as a nice way to communicate about complex goals and projects.","Cons: The usability of the software has improved over the years, but it still can be rather cumbersome to use and navigate between tasks. When onboarding a new hire, it often takes more time to bring them up to speed on how to use our project management software than it would to actually complete some of their tasks. The buttons aren't always where you would expect them to be, and the organization of tasks can get quite convoluted unless someone is very intentional with how they organize each project."
452,452 Asana,Asana,Ryan T.,Operations Manager,Commercial Real Estate,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,“A Review on Asana.”,"Overall: We were happy that Asana had three different options for pricing plans, and we were able to go with the one that suited us best as a firm. The free account definitely had limits in terms of usage, but it provided an all-around sampling of what our user experience would be. The core features of Asana have provided us with a decent Return on Investment. Again, the tools for task management are top notch. Creation and assignment of tasks is very intuitive, and we have found it pretty stress-free to go back in at a later time, and add items such as comments and due dates. Attaching files takes no time at all. Very quick. We also enjoy the idea that there are no limits to the number of projects we can establish with help from Asana.",21/8/2018,"Pros: Asana is a goldmine as far as productivity is involved. I really like the collaborative emphasis placed on team structure workflow management, and it is ideal for task management as well. Asana is one of the best productivity boosters that I have witnessed in terms of team applications.","Cons: Asana is not necessarily software built for project management. It doesn't incorporate time-tracking or tools utilized for managing projects, specifically. As far as work flow and task management, Asana is highly flexible and reliable. The potential is there for even the smallest startup."
453,453 Asana,Asana,Amit B.,General Manager Human Resources,Education Management,2+ years,5,4,4,4,5,8,“i have been using Asana for the past 3 years and it has been very helpful for me. ”,Overall: - Easy tracking of my tasks on a daily basis - Extremely good functionality and ability to customize tasks as per requirement - Very good desktop interface - I like the flying unicorn image that comes on the screen when you complete a task,26/7/2018,Pros: - Basic application is free of charge - You can have one task and then sub - sub taks under the main tasks and you can also allocate that sub-sub task to your team members - You can have multiple team members - You can create multiple projects - You can calenderise your tasks with either outlook or google calendars - You can create an entire dashboard to view the status on projects,"Cons: - The app is not that good in comparison to the desktop application. The Asana team should work in bringing the desktop ease in the app as well - If you have multiple accounts linked into one, sometimes it creates problem when you want to move to the premium version"
454,454 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,7,"“Asana is a really nice tool, especially for the price - free for its core features!”","Overall: I really like the basic task management features, especially with its integration with Gmail through some Chrome/Gmail extensions, and this makes it really easy to push your emails into projects & tasks without much time or effort.",24/7/2018,"Pros: Asana looks great and feels very ""professional"", unlike some others in its category. It has so many cool integrations, flowing into and out of Asana, and it appears to be growing. Asana does a great job of handling details & subtasks allowing you to branch out from your primary task at hand, while keeping the overall project flow understandable. Its also nice that you can create a project in a list-oriented setup or a kanban style setup. You can even create a project out of a current task if that task grows in scope. Calendaring and status reports are very effective when used in Asana.","Cons: Asana's price jump from free to paid (billed annually) is a little steep but it does bring along some nice features like unlimited dashboards if you want to separate out your projects. I think advanced search used to be in the free offering, which was really nice because you could save your search results as links, but now it's going to cost you for that."
455,455 Asana,Asana,Kate J.,Growth Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,5,5,5,8,“Great task and project manager.”,,2/7/2018,,"Cons: The UI can be overwhelmingly noisy, until you both get used to it, and get comfortable removing some things from your views."

I love that I can set up tasks - and then sub-tasks underneath it, with each sub-task having its own due date and conversation, as well as allowing each one to be assigned to separate team members. You can choose to receive an email each time a comment is made on a task you are involved in, and you can reply directly from your email instead of having to login to Asana, which is a definite time-saver and helps to keep the conversations in the correct threads.","Cons: I wish there was a way to switch from list view to board view in a project instead of having to choose just one, but the use of sections makes the list view easier to organize. Otherwise, I really can't think of any cons, and I am using the free version!"

Ensures our team is effective in managing ongoing and one-off projects with ease. The roles and permissions allow us to easily collaborate on projects without overwhelming everyone with too much information and too many notifications. The new Timeline (Gantt chart) allows us to visually see our milestones easily and spot possible risks. The app is easy to use. There are loads of great features - one of my favourites being the flying unicorn that appears when I complete a task. Hooray for mini-celebrations! With the help of zapier, our workflows are super automated.","Cons: The paid version is a little steep with larger teams, but well worth the cost. The custom template functionality needs a bit of love - we seem to need to make a bunch of adjustments every time we launch a template project."

From the rest I find a great app and whose free version is as good as the paid versions of other similar apps.

Are you not going to breathe it? It will change the way you organize your life. Word of advice, integrate it to everything. It will soon replace those systems for you.",20/3/2018,"Pros: Asana is something that can be learned in 10 minutes, can be used for free, can keep you on track at work, keep you on track at home, integrate into everything else you use, tell you where you need to improve, and so so so much more. Asana raises the bar for what they do. I really can't name a better alternative. I have Asana on my phone, linked to my slack, linked to my Gmail account (3 total), I have my wife on Asana, my creative teammates on Asana. Just get it",Cons: Literally none that I am aware of. Even the price is far below what it could be. I truely can not name a single feature I would add. I have never needed to contact support because they made a perfect tool.
460,460 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,4,3,3,8,"“Pretty great tool overall, can definitely get your team in sync and organized.”","Overall: It's a great tool for collaboration as well as team and project management. It's highly beneficial to get your team on the same page, know what is expected, set deadlines, and get work done.",16/3/2018,"Pros: I really like that you can have multiple projects within one team and allow each to be seen by the entire team or only by specific individuals. The ability to add a task with a due date, and add sub-tasks with individual due dates is pretty great. I also really like the ability to add sections, assign tasks to individuals, set recurring tasks, upload files, sync with my phone, sync with my Google Drive, and get stuff done. It's surprising how many features are available, and how usable this product is, even on the free version.","Cons: I absolutely detest ""per user"" pricing. I think it is the worst pay structure ever invented. I think that the price per person (when purchased annually) is absurd. I'd be far more likely to pay for this product continually if it was a higher monthly price with 10-20 users, then an additional fee per bunch of users."
461,461 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“simply the easiest teamwork tool on the internet today”,"Overall: loads of times saved exchanging emails and chats. all our teams are together and separate at the same time. they are together in projects which overlap and they are separate in projects which they are unique to. speed is key here. so many people working at the same time. some projects are also open to clients, so they get a hang of how much effort we put in and how much detail we focus on for their work... it helps them see the value for the money they spend",7/3/2018,"Pros: easy to understand, no learning curve. discreet visual separation of every task, sub-task, project, team, organisation. very fast & responsive UI. robust even when loaded with tons of data, useful integrations with other apps.","Cons: mobile apps are good, but can do better. especially iOS app. for a heavy user, there should be easy posting and editing access right from the home screen. plus the UX is somehow a rundown experience vs the desktop UX.. too many clicks going in and coming back of a small edit."

It's very easy to use. The navigation is very intuitive. It also allows you to attach files from Google Drive. It's also very easy for collaboration. Passing items quickly between team members and communicating on individual projects is a breeze.,"Cons: It's difficult to visualize project timelines. We have started experimenting with Gantt chart extensions that turn your asana task lists into Gantt charts. It can also be difficult to collaborate with clients. They don't always need to see ""how the sausage is made"" -- but this means we have to create separate project plans that are client facing. This requires lot of updates since asana doesn't sync with Google Spreadsheets."

And you can have all of that in the free account too.",18/1/2018,"Pros: Asana was the first PM software that I've used many years ago. But, after researching and getting to know other tools I abandoned Asana. At that time Asana was good, but not great. Since them I used Trello, Redbooth, Wrike and other tools. Then, after they released the Board functionality, I decided to give Asana another chance. And I was surprised to see that not only the boards were a great implementation, but there were many new functions and A LOT of improvement in the basic features. Nowadays, I think Asana is the best, most complete and most flexible PM software that I've ever used.","Cons: Its time to put more formatting options for the description and comments areas (Markdown, PLEASE Asana). For newcommers and people that are not used to work with PMs, the interface may be a little overwhelming when compared with other PMs softwares."
465,465 Asana,Asana,Rachel L.,Marketing Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,5,5,4,,9,“Great project management tool especially for managing ”,"OverallPros: Easy to use, great for coordinating among multiple team members, project templates are customizable making it easy template reoccurring projects, easy to set and manage deadlines, task list can be organized into sections to help prioritize outstanding tasks, inbox features allows for task updates and questions to be easily managed, ability to forward emails directly to Asana to create a task, like features make is a nice way to give positive feedback to teammates, ability to set a deadline for specific tasks, dashboard feature gives a nice overview of the progress of a project (e.g. 10 completed tasks, 22 outstanding tasks), progress status allows team members to identify any obstacles that are slowing down or stalling the project..",7/9/2017,,Cons: Task list can become overwhelming when managing multiple projects but that may be more of a reflection of my workload than the software itself.
466,466 Asana,Asana,Garrett J.,Web Developer,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,9,“Asana Helps our team get work done!”,"Overall: We've developed a custom solution that lets us bring in work order requests into Asana for different departments (Marketing/IT/Facilities), and then collaborate inside Asana. By putting work orders into Asana we've reduced our dependence on email, and increased visibility into work that's getting done across our organization. We also use it inside departments for organizing tasks, planning events, and general project management. The only real bummer with Asana is the tiered pricing structure. Asana provides a lot of value, but it shouldn't cost you more per user the more users you have... it should be less.",22/11/2016,"Pros: It doesn't take us long to onboard new users, because it's ridiculously easy to use",Cons: Because it's so free-form sometimes staff members end up changing things that they shouldn't. It also is missing the ability to have conversations and comments that are private to a team on public tasks.
467,467 Asana,Asana,Chad W.,Creative Arts & Discipleship Pastor,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana is by far the best team-based project-management software I've ever used.”,"Overall: Asana is by far the best team-based project-management software I've ever used. Years ago, I got sick of writing down tasks on random scraps of paper that was around me, texting myself, emailing myself, taking meeting notes in Word docs, etc. I realized I needed a central storehouse of organized tasks to guide my productivity. Asana was the perfect answer. I had a great experience with Todoist as a personal task-management software, but I needed something for big projects, and something more oriented to team communication. I don't know how they do it, but if your team is small, Asana is FREE. I can't believe they've kept this up for as long as they have, but they have",3/11/2016,"Pros: The amazing features, the FREE cost, the team-communication features. It allows you to take on enormous projects detail by detail.","Cons: It might be nice to be able to have more sub-tasks below main tasks, but I also think that they way they structure sub-tasks is really effective."

Easy to collaborate. Nice to see daily tasks and what is upcoming in the next few days.,Cons: Hard to get others as invested. If the whole team doesn't use it the usefulness decreases greatly. You can quickly get lost sorting through tasks/ projects/ sub tasks/ sub-sub tasks and so on.
469,469 Asana,Asana,Janice L.,Sr Performance Marketing Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Favourite Task Management Tool”,,21/10/2020,,"Cons: Nothing really - the only thing is that there are some teammates that are less familiar with Asana. I've been using it for 4+ years now, so I've been able to continuously optimize the way I'm using Asana. When some folks are less familiar with Asana and therefore less willing to use it, it can cause some gaps."

I have tried others but keep coming back to Asana.,6/10/2020,Pros: The interface is aesthetically pleasing and fun to use. Once you get over the first learning curve it's fairly easy to navigate,Cons: There are a lot of options and features you can use with Asana which involves a learning curve when you first start. Not a terrible thing but may not be the best choice for someone with bare bone basic needs.
472,472 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“A Great Assistant Your Daily Task and Project Management”,"Overall: We have been using Asana for more than 5 years. During this time, many new features have been added and continue to be added. One of the most important reasons for us to choose Asana is that it keeps itself up-to-date and responds to our management needs that have changed over time.",29/9/2020,Pros: Asana is one of the most flexible and scalable task management tools for your management needs. You may use it both just daily todo list and for your bigger projects with your team.,"Cons: Although Asana has not a native time tracking feature within, you can integrate some great third-party tools to track time while managing your projects with Asana. But it would be better Asana had a builtin time tracking feature to track billable times."

Asana has helped me with so much organization. I absolutely love the fact that it syncs with Slack so notifications are sent to Slack. It's super user-friendly and sends you daily email notifications for reminders, which I prefer.","Cons: The only thing that I don't like is not being able to ""see"" recurring tasks. You can set the tasks as recurring but it doesn't visually show every week that it's recurring. For example, if I have a recurring task that happens every Friday, until I mark the task as ""done"" it won't appear the next Friday. This feature definitely is a downfall because I like seeing tasks ahead of time. So to combat this, I manually put in new tasks for myself and my writers."

I really enjoy to collaborate using this tool.,18/8/2020,Pros: Asana is intuitive and easy to use which will allow you to be more efficient in your workplace. I like the fact that it allows you to become transparent about the task that who is doing what. You can easily be updated about the work progress and make quick decisions. I like to use the free version of Asana its full of various features and functionality and plenty of options so that you can utilize it. I really like the way multiple people use it at the same time and share everything which saves time. You can manage all the task here and people can join to share about their work update.,Cons: The fact is Asana allows only 15 members in the free version which is a small number. I think they should have mid-level pricing for small entrepreneurs. Sometimes its difficult to have quick communication with a large team because of the communication tool which is not super-fast.
476,476 Asana,Asana,Anna K.,Head of Marketing,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,4,,5,10,“Maybe I should use it in my personal life too...”,"Overall: I had a great experience with Asana. It's reasonably easy to pick up, I have never had to reach out to support, which is always a good sign. Asana streamlined my productivity and organization - I sometimes wonder if I should use it in my personal life too...",17/7/2020,"Pros: Asana makes task management much easier. Folowing who's working on what and what tasks I should be taking care of is a breeze. In an Agile team, this software is an absolute must-have. I don't know how companies that don't use task management software keep up with their workflows. Asana is fairly easy to pick up and it can sit well within any departments work method.","Cons: This is more of a pro and con: they release new features very regularly and some of the new releases don't feel like improvements and they are hard to get used to. But of course, how we've would they iterate and improve."

Now, we had individual tasks broken down by the task owner.",7/4/2020,"Pros: Asana is a very easy product to use for project organization and team management. As a marketing team, we only use Asana now to organize our project timelines.",Cons: There is no way to archive a portfolio which is a collection of projects. You can archive individual projects but not a collection of projects.

We can easily maintain and arrange projects and assignments by keeping everyone connected together via this tool. It allow us to keep a track in a better way and improves our working efficiency in a lot more productive ways.,"Cons:  Although we never had faced any kind of major issues in using this tool, but sometimes files are bit difficult to share among each other.

Status updates are only a couple of clicks away.,25/7/2019,"Pros: Easy to set up and understand. You can create an account or link to an existing Google account. Mobile app for iOS and Android makes for easy on the go tasking. The flow from creating, working on, and completing tasks is so simple and intuitive that you don't even have to get used to it.",Cons: The knowledgebase is mostly just videos. I'm a little old school and tend to like reading about features rather than watching. More of a preference thing than anything wrong with the product.

Asana is constantly updating its features as well so every once in a while I'll get new features that I didn't know I needed.","Cons: Developers might not like it due to the lack of code pending, merging, etc., but it's very team specific."

It provides a user-friendly interface that's quick to learn and easy to navigate, making it simple to quickly note task needs, ideas, and action items - as well as plan for larger projects.","Cons: Asana offers only basic reporting functionality in terms of assessing workload or quantifying task volume (hours worked, project progress, resource allocation, etc.). The main reporting function is a simple search for tasks. While the search tool is robust and easy to filter tasks by various custom fields and dimensions, this is limited to the platform in the form of task or ""to do"" lists. However, Asana integrates with a variety of tools for needs beyond basic task management."
486,486 Asana,Asana,Allison B.,Content Marketing Consultant,Writing and Editing,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“Easy-To-Use Project Management Tool”,Overall:,2/1/2019,"Pros: You can't beat the price of the basic package - free! Even the premium and business packages are VERY affordable for what you get. Asana is one of the most robust free project management tools on the market, and my go-to option when I need to organize tasks for myself or a client.","Cons: Honestly, there aren't many cons to using Asana. I guess the biggest issue is that the UI isn't super intuitive, in my opinion, so there is a bit of a learning curve. I still occasionally come across a feature or way to use Asana that I didn't previously know about."
487,487 Asana,Asana,Adam G.,Senior Graphic Designer,Consumer Goods,2+ years,4,4,4,,,7,“Straight Forward Project View”,"Overall: I now know where any project is at any given time. It has really given me a birds eye view of everything that is going on. It doesn't matter what project it is, you can create a solution to manage it.",4/12/2018,"Pros: Above all, I love the ease at which I can see what my entire team is working on at any given time. It gives me the ability to look at the overall workflow and reassign / juggle what anyone is working on to better help the team work through all of our busy times. For personal use it is really great to be able to see what my timelines / week looks like so I can plan accordingly. Plus when you complete a task it gives you some cool graphics as a congrats, not super helpful, but fun non the less.","Cons: Asana has a lot of great features, but I do not love the navigation on the left portion of the site. IT makes it a little challenging to find what you need when you have a lot of different teams. However, you don't really need to use it if you are just trying to find one person or project, just use the search bar."
488,488 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Even the free version is great!”,Overall: Organizing our major projects into manageable chunks. Getting our team on the same page and managing workloads and timelines properly. My team and I regularly say we don't know how we managed projects before Asana. I am using my paper to-do list less and less and using just Asana for EVERY task. No more tasks slipping through the cracks,28/11/2018,"Pros: The ability to not only assign tasks from the platform, but also email tasks directly to the platform or set up zapier tasks to create tasks in the system. The calendar feature is awesome and the platform is so easy to use. It gives the ability to both create checklists of tasks or a post on a board to track and organize tasks - so you can modify your management to however your employees work best. Plus, you can set vacation time on your account so you aren't assigned a due date for when you'll be out of office - brilliant","Cons: That there are a lot of cool features I miss out on because we don't want to pay to upgrade to Premium. For the free version, you really get to do a lot. We don't have access to timelines, templates and priority settings but if we upgraded, Asana would definitely prove to be that much more powerful for us."
489,489 Asana,Asana,Oleksandr T.,Product Manager,Internet,2+ years,4,5,4,,4,8,“A perfect tool for group collaboration”,,24/11/2018,,"Cons: It is obvious that there are no perfect programs and Asana is not an exception. Speaking about Asana, there are some drawbacks in this service which I'd like to be mentioned. To start with, sometimes notifications work with a delay. It seems that in such case, you have to open Asana constantly so you could stay up to date with your purposes. In addition, Asana's mobile application has some drawbacks which must be fixed. In general, it should be improved."
490,490 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Consumer Goods,2+ years,4,5,4,5,5,8,“Great for task management”,,12/11/2018,,"Cons: I wish there was a better/easier way to set user permissions. I don't love how everyone is set up with the same permissions and able to change things. Another feature I would love to see is the ability to block off company holiday's or users PTO for smoother planning for the project managers instead of them having to adjust dates while trying to remember who has what time off, especially as a lot of time is taken off from team members during the holidays."

I thought I loved another service where I can store lots of my notes a lot, but after learning to use Asana to its full potential, I'm in awe of how much more productive I am, thanks to this product. It's great for lists, notes, reminders, honey-do-lists, goals, dreams, bucket-lists, you name it. You can even attach photos and documents, and delegate things to yourself and others... it's just GREAT","Cons: I love practically everything in Asana, but if I had 1 wish it would be that you would provide all the features in the premium version to everybody. And if that's too much to ask... then you could continue to implement awesome features more frequently. But I have no complaints and just a whole bunch of gratitude for the Asana team. :)"
492,492 Asana,Asana,Charlotte C.,Project Manager,Utilities,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,9,"“Asana is great, looking forward to a few more upgrades”","Overall: Our company has been using Asana since April, and there has been mixed reaction. Some folks are fully on board and have turned off their email notifications. They are keeping up with their tasks and are diligent about assigning new tasks for long-term projects so we don't lose momentum. Others aren't quite up to speed still, which makes it difficult to operate as a unit. A few things I would love to see: ability to copy a task with a ""waiting on"" dependency from a template to a new project and retain the ""waiting on"". Also, would like to see some best practices for assigning tasks back and forth versus creating subtasks for specific projects. When projects get assigned back and forth, you lose the ability to search through ""completed tasks"". Lastly, we are also using Slack and haven't quite established a good standard operating procedure for what files get shared in Asana vs. Slack, which sometimes results in us struggling to find where past conversations are documented. Not sure if there is a good solution for that, but more detailed tips and tricks for advanced users are always appreciated.",10/11/2016,"Pros: Great UI experience, love the keyboard shortcuts. Search functionality is useful, keeps all team members accountable.",Cons: Less tech-savvy employees are not able to consistently use all features.

495,495 Asana,Asana,Vinay S.,Programmatic Director,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Very social project management tool”,Overall: I would definitely recommend Asana to small to mid sized teams as it makes it really easy to manage work.,23/9/2020,Pros: Its really cool how well they have made the tool intuitive and bring the social experience of using a Social network to project management. In my opinion this makes it easier for much of the younger team to use the platform - essentially increasing the involvement in the tool to work effectively together.,"Cons: It was slightly tricky to get the app working correctly on Apple but once you have the hang of it, its all good."
496,496 Asana,Asana,Vijaya Sankar N.,Associate Tech Lead,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,5,,,8,“Using the free version for my small team”,Overall: Am overall satisfied with the free features it offers. I use it OOTB and meet my needs.,24/8/2020,"Pros: I am using the free version of Asana that does more than what I need. Provides robust features needed for the tasks. The main pro for Asana is its ability to switch to different view - Calendar, List, Kanban, Timeline.","Cons: I am satisfied overall with the product. It can create some better integrations with MS Teams, that suits the purpose more."

It is easy to use, straightforward, and the app is fantastic as well. It is nice to be able to manage tasks across all platforms","Cons: There are a handful of things like the way subtasks are assigned that aren't super intuitive for me.

499,499 Asana,Asana,Zack K.,Director,Computer Networking,2+ years,4,5,3,,,7,“Powerful collaborative project and task management tool”,"Overall: While the project management space is quite packed, Asana manages to stand out as a capable option.",16/6/2020,"Pros: Asana is very versatile yet feels like a focused PM tool. The UI and UX is extremely well done, making the app very enjoyable to use. It's very simple to create projects, create tasks, manage timelines, milestones, achievements, and assign tasks to project members. I even get a kick out of being able to LIKE certain tasks. The free tier sports all the features you need to manage your own projects. Mobile app is nicely designed and even supports dark mode.","Cons: Loading of tasks and responsiveness can occasionally be slow in the mobile app. Since you may have a lot of projects and tasks, at times it can be easy to lose track of where you are. Mobile app can be streamlined, having a separate button for search is unnecessary. I would prefer to do most of the work out of the HOME screen. No gantt chart view although there is list and board view."

It really helps keep you organized and the daily reminders are very helpful when deadlines are fast approaching. Also, I tend to travel for my job and when I'm out of the office, this platform helps me track the progress of certain projects without having to send out a handful of emails.",Cons: Asana is constantly finding new ways to improve the platform (which is great) but sometimes they change up the layout without notification that it can sometimes be an unpleasant surprise.

Asana encourages collaboration and it's easy to invite people to join your project. I use Asana to manage work related projects and side-projects. They offer many project templates to help you get started. It's also a nice place to jot down tasks and visualize the timeline (premium option),"Cons: Many of the best features are premium, however the free version does offer enough to get by. At the beginning the UI was decidedly simple, over time it has gotten more features. Of course Asana works best if everyone is onboard so it's necessary to get everyone to buy in. It's a bit more complex for a generic task manager, so I gravitate towards other apps for that."
505,505 Asana,Asana,Maria A.,Influencer,Online Media,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“What keeps me organized”,"Overall: Really love it. It was hard, at first, to find the best method for me, but now that I have, it's the most wonderful thing that ever happen to my work life.",30/9/2019,"Pros: I love that it keeps me organized. I have many things I need to do as a ""Blogger"", so I created a main project and added to it all the small projects I have to do to keep me organized (Youtube, Instagram, Newsletters...), that way, in the main project, I can organize them by color and understand what I did and what I have to do on a specific month. It's great! Truly the only method, and app, that worked for me.","Cons: It took me a while to get the hang of it, maybe a week or so, but with practice I started to get better at it. I think it is a bit complicated to learn, even with all their tutorials."
506,506 Asana,Asana,Lauren W.,Global Giving Database Manager,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,,,8,“Asana helps teams get things done”,Overall: Asana allows teams to connect and come together to work on multiple projects simultaneously. Project management for our marketing team has dramatically improved since we adopted Asana.,31/8/2019,"Pros: The best feature Asana offers is the building out of tasks for projects. Users can be assigned individual tasks with due dates. Tasks can be used as a place to hold tags, comments, and files. It makes archiving and reviewing older projects easy.","Cons: My least favorite feature about Asana is the way they handle their alerts and tagging. To the best of my knowledge, (and my team's) we get an alert for everything or nothing. I have worked on editing the alerts system and haven't had much luck. When a team member includes you on a project, you will receive alerts even if the tasks don't belong to you. It makes your email count sky rocket."
507,507 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,5,4,4,4,9,“Asana - superb task management!”,Overall: One of the best task management tools on the market,6/8/2019,Pros: Essy to use and assignment of people to tasks. Also a good interface and app.,Cons: Not being able to assign multiple people to a single task as well as linking to files on internal servers or drives.
508,508 Asana,Asana,Whitney B.,Owner,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Great for Keeping Our Team On Track”,Overall: Great I have used it for my team as well as helped some of my clients start using it for their project management.,15/7/2019,Pros: It is so easy to use. There is little to no learning curve needed with this software. Very user-friendly.,Cons: It does send a lot of notifications and the chat with team function could be better.
509,509 Asana,Asana,Margaret W.,Marketing/Communications Assistant,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,8,“Asana Review”,Overall:,22/5/2019,"Pros: What I like most about Asana is that it lets you visualize where you and coworkers are at on multiple projects and helps track progress. In your personal Asana you have the ability to add followers to your task so when you are complete or are updating, others on the project will be notified. Due dates are huge because Asana will remind you when you have a project coming up that is due soon. You are also able to create customizable calendars for different areas or projects within a company. This helps workflow and lets everybody see what people are working on for the day and if you need to assign workers specific tasks and what not.",Cons: What I liked least about this software was that it is not very graphic-user friendly. I worked with some graphic designers and Asana was a little bit of struggle to insert graphics and download them and what not.
510,510 Asana,Asana,Nicholas C.,Director of Technology,Education Management,2+ years,4,3,3,4,4,8,“Robust software for project management”,"Overall: I started looking for a project management tool that could track tasks and subtasks more logically and in an organizational method that was better applied to teamwork than the more visually tiled interfaces or popular alternatives. When we were able to define project -> tasks -> and subtasks and then assign, discuss, and reference associated materials both in the asana interface as well as plug ins to our communication platforms it enhanced our ability to stay on track. Even personally, I use it to track projects that are larger than single task helpdesk tickets and retain communication with end users on things that require multiple steps.",22/4/2019,Pros: I feel the extensiveness of the options and features of this product put it heads above the alternatives. Almost any imaginable scenario you might face it has the capability to handle. I have found the ability to plug in to Microsoft groups or slack and countless other methods various teams might use to communicate but have the crossover of the central project management of shared goals.,"Cons: I would say that the robustness which is such an advantage for Asana can also be a drawback, as the options can be overwhelming to users and team leaders as they figure out how to set up their workflows in the environment."
511,511 Asana,Asana,Bruce B.,Senior Operations Officer,Research,2+ years,5,5,5,4,4,10,“Probably the best way to organise work”,Overall: The overall experience is very rewarding.,5/2/2019,"Pros: Asana is one of the few products which combines ergonomic usage with beautiful design and a powerful API. Teams have different styles - KANBAN doesn't work for everyone, neither do swimlanes or todo-lists. Projects an be equally difficult to shoehorn into standard styles -- managers nevertheless need to know when things are done, how much they cost and when they are expected. Asana has the layouts and templates to suit the style of your team and project. It provides a feature-full API which can be used to develop custom workflows for business or development needs. The key features which we used in Asana tasks were the ability to set a date, recurring tasks, sub tasks, task assignment and reminders.","Cons: For small teams or open source projects, the price can be a bit inhibitive. The free version of the product does not give access to a few key functions like the burndown chart. Sometimes with large projects, the strain can also be a bit much on the browser, and slow the app down. Support for Markdown would also be nice."
512,512 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,3,5,10,“Affordable Project Management”,Overall: I've been using it since the start. Asana has single-handedly helped keep me organized. I've introduced it to all my clients who are hooked as well,1/2/2019,"Pros: It's price! You really cannot beat this project management software for the price. The free version is so robust and has so much value. I even have my own project for my family - I love it that much! You can upgrade to the paid version, which takes your project management up a notch. They add new things daily. I love the calendar view and the boards. Its easy to assign projects, dates, and repeat tasks. It also integrates with slack.","Cons: Like all project management software it takes a bit of time to enter things in a coherent order but they do have templates to help you with that. If you frequently do the same thing, makes sense to use a template."
513,513 Asana,Asana,Jenny P.,Content Marketing Specialist,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,4,,,7,“Keep Track of Projects Among the Team”,Overall: We use Asana to keep all team members in the loop and avoid dropping the ball. We use project calendars for emails and ad submissions and upload files to Asana. We are also now starting to project manage our own to-do lists and utilize Asana more than ever before.,10/12/2018,"Pros: I like that there's one set place for team members to see calendars, upload projects and communicate with one another.","Cons: I don't like the emails that appear in my inbox. Unlike Basecamp's, which are simple and to the point with the message someone sent via Basecamp, Asana seems to send an email every time you add a new version of a file (and sometimes the files don't appear when I've added them to a calendar, leading me to upload several times and others to receive several unnecessary emails). I also think it lacks some intuitiveness and colleagues have expressed frustration that every time you add a new project, even if you already are within a team's calendar, you have to add all members one by one to the project. It's very time consuming and annoying."
514,514 Asana,Asana,Andrés E. B.,Analista sénior,Consumer Services,2+ years,4,4,3,4,3,10,“ Make a plan? Easy peasy”,"Overall: The results after having incorporated this tool to our day to day, are incalculable. Now we work as one, we are one.",30/11/2018,"Pros: In corporate environments planning is very important. However, the use I have given you is somewhat different. Apart from my work, I serve as a collaborator in an ecommerce project and as many of you will know, in something like that the organization is no less important. For our luck, Asana is a tool that has a mobile App, an element that makes our days much simpler. Another aspect that I would highlight is the opportunity to see all the tasks or ideas that you have planned to execute in an organized way, with dates, responsible, etc. Finally, I would like to add that in terms of communication, Asana has made it possible for everyone involved to be aware of what each person is working on and also gives the opportunity to leave opinions or comments related to a particular topic.","Cons: If you are not willing to spend money, that may be something negative, maybe not Asana properly, but for the user. There are some interesting features that you must pay to be able to use them."
515,515 Asana,Asana,Ashley R.,Digital Marketing,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,"“Keeps me on track with projects, to-do's and timelines”","Overall: Asana keeps us organized and on task, and allows us to create a hierarchy of tasks that are urgent, while not forgetting those tasks that often get pushed back - and without a tool like this, might never be completed.",19/9/2018,"Pros: Asana is essential for keeping me on track - both with daily tasks and targets, as well as longer term projects. I use it with multiple companies that I work with and for, and it allows me to easily toggle between companies, without having to log out and back in again. I can create projects, and tasks - assign tasks to other members of projects, and I get alerts when due dates are approaching or missed. You can even sync their to-do calendar with my imac or outlook calendar so that it comes up on my daily schedule, with all of my to-dos (so that I don't have to look in multiple places). Its a must have tool in my day to day business operations.","Cons: There isn't really much if anything that is missing with this software, its a great tool!"
516,516 Asana,Asana,Puru P.,Startup Manager,Capital Markets,2+ years,4,5,5,4,4,9,“A tool for many needs”,Overall: We are getting our deadlines meet by Asana and assigning tasks to employees keeping a track of them. We also have prioritised the tasks with it's help to get know what we need first and what can wait. We are achieving a responsible behavior in employees with Asana.,19/7/2018,"Pros: Asana performs many functionalities under one hood. I can keep track of all the works assigned to me and converse with people who assigned that to me. In the similar fashion I can get to know what things I assigned to employees and what is the progress for the task. From small business to a large business , it fits in for the needs. You can just send links for progress, upload files and customise it as you want to, it is very simple. The discussions through comments achieve pretty many things in development.","Cons: We can have many tasks categorized under one , rather than making a new task for every new employee , even when the task is same. I would like to see more pricing options in asana according to team size."
517,517 Asana,Asana,Katie S.,Graphics Manager,Graphic Design,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Easy Project Management”,,16/5/2018,,"Cons: User interface is slightly confusing at first glance, specifically when learning the difference between Tasks and Projects, but overall easy to use once learned. I haven't used the full realm of capabilities of this product (our current project load does not call for a great capacity) but for basic needs it is very satisfactory."
518,518 Asana,Asana,April B.,Teacher,Unspecified,2+ years,5,4,5,4,4,7,“My experience was very pleasant and I thoroughly enjoyed using this software with my students. ”,"Overall: I was able to share documents with my students in a very timely manner, as well as communicate with them without sending several time consuming emails. I was also able to save time as I was able to use the app for several different things.",27/3/2018,Pros: The thing that I enjoyed most about this software was the fact that I could easily organize work in one simple place. I am also a huge fan of the fact that I can communicate with my students within the app as it means I do not have to send out several different emails which can be very frustrating and time consuming. I also like the fact that I am alerted when a change is made to any of my documents as then I can can review what changes were made very easily.,Cons: The biggest thing that I do not like about this particular software is the fact that I can not merge calender's with other users of the application. This has caused trouble several times for my students as they are not able to see the due date of particular documents. The other thing that I like least about the software also involves the calendar. I wish that there was the ability to create a calendar in general and not for a specific task.
519,519 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Writing and Editing,2+ years,5,4,4,,,10,“The easiest way to manage my team.”,,20/3/2018,,Cons: I can't use Asana to keep track of events (meetings) that go along with each project. Would love to see different calendar views.
520,520 Asana,Asana,Donna W.,Compliance Manager,E-Learning,2+ years,4,4,4,2,5,10,“Love the abilities it has. It's a great holding tank for information!”,"Overall: It manages my work and personal life for tasks. The things it needs is an option to do a gant sheet or see all of the items in one view. I have a ton of projects that our team does at one time and it's hard to see what we are working on and how long it takes because there is no start and end date involved. Just a task date. The tags are helpful so I can add in quarter 1 or quarter 2 but it could improve in the areas of visuals. Right now the calendar only shows today's due dates, not the projects working on, etc.",17/5/2017,"Pros: I love that it holds all the information I need in one place and you can create a due date. You can share with others, add tasks for others, and comment on the project so that everyone is updated","Cons: The due date is great if it is a one and done, and there is a repeater of every week you can add, so I use this app for my bills...and it works perfect. But is you want a project start and end date that isn't so easy."
521,521 Asana,Asana,Dana S.,Customer Support Team Lead,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,4,,,10,“It's just so easy!”,"Overall: I started using Asana with our Customer Support Leadership team to track and assign tasks to each other and stay on top of things. We looked at a couple other options that were maybe ""more robust"" but I love how easy Asana is. I like/love the commenting and ""<3"" feature and it's sort of become a phrase to ""Just Asana it to me please"".",6/12/2016,"Pros: Just how easy it is; New task? Enter; New topic/divider? Colon; Assign it to someone, repeat deadlines/tasks etc. It's all fairly intuitive and I haven't needed to use very many support resources to get off the ground.","Cons: I think this is maybe more of a ME thing than Asana (PEBCAK etc), but if I set a due date on some items for quite a ways in the future, sometimes it tucks under ""Later"" sometimes not. I usually still want to see these things and would like that to be not automatically done. I feel like that's a pretty week con, I really can't think of anything that irritates me about Asana."
522,522 Asana,Asana,Julian I.,CEO,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,4,,5,8,"“Fantastic free tool to manage workload. Slow loading times makes it frustrating, however.”","Overall: Asana is a fantastic tool that understands the power and attractiveness of simplicity in a project management tool. It is easy to get started and pretty to look at. It provides a lot of flexibility when categorizing tasks, but the uniformity in the input of tasks doesn't allow for a quick and easy visualization of the differing hierarchy of tasks. Speed issues are the main cause for disappointment.",18/11/2016,Pros: Quick to onboard new teammates. Simple to use. Very flexible. Free.,"Cons: It takes anywhere from 5-15 seconds to load the tasks, and it doesn't even fetch the whole list. Scrolling below the fold makes it fetch the next batch of tasks. This presents a frustrating experience that they seriously consider addressing."
523,523 Asana,Asana,Bridgette T.,Director of Supply,Logistics and Supply Chain,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“Supply Director Review”,"Overall: I love asana! I started using it when I was an Operations Manager at Uber. Asana was a little irritating at first because I was so overwhelmed with tasks and working crazy hours, the last thing I wanted to do was provide an update on my work, but once I became a manager, I realized how useful the tool was. I work for another start-up called Veyo now, and it has been incredibly useful keeping my team's tasks organized and making sure no task, no matter how big or small, gets dropped.",3/11/2016,,"Cons: When you're assigned a subtask, it can be confusing. For example, when we have to put together pricing for multiple states, we'll make the parent task Provider Pricing and then the subtasks will be Texas, California, Idaho. But then the assignee only sees the state instead of the parent task. Is there a way to make the parent task more pronounced so I don't have to put Provider Pricing Texas, Provider Pricing California, and Provider Pricing Idaho?"
524,524 Asana,Asana,Brittney B.,Graphic Designer,Apparel & Fashion,2+ years,5,4,3,3,4,10,“Life Saving Software”,"Overall: Asana has made my transition into a new company a breeze. The software is easy to use and offers many different tips and tricks to make day to day task assignments easy and straightforward. The interface is sleek and clean. Assignees can assign due dates and times that are very apparent in each task. This allows tasks for the day to easily be organized by priority. Asana is not only efficient and easy to use, it is also fun. There are even settings that allow mini celebrations when tasks are finished which adds some excitement to checking off a task. Asana makes communication within the office stream lined and easy to follow with inbox project comment notifications. It also makes working at home a possibility with task comments and due dates. The asana team keeps users updated through email. If the software is updated, useres receive an easy to read email about what the new update entails. My experience with Asana has been great, it is my favorite task management system yet.",3/11/2016,Pros: Easy to Use Easy to Assign Tasks Easy to Follow Projects Easy to Keep Track of Assignments and projects Easy to control settings,
525,525 Asana,Asana,Brent K.,Developer,1-10 employees,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,"“Great task management tool, I couldn't be productive without it”","Overall: I suggested that my team start using asana and it took a bit of coaxing but we jumped in and found it to be really really useful. That was 2 years ago and we've been tracking most of our work using asana, from day-to-day tasks all the way to our roadmap. It's been really great to see new features like custom fields become available. It really makes you feel like you made the right choice when an app just grows more and more into what you actually need.",3/11/2016,Pros: It offers lots of flexibility but still keeps things really simple.,Cons: I don't have any real complaints about the app. It seems like I can't always get back to the task list from the details pane using the hotkeys anymore but that's a pretty minor annoyance.
526,526 Asana,Asana,Colin H.,Director of Communications,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,"“One Church, Three Locations and 70+ team members running smoothly”","Overall: I literally could not do my job without Asana. I would be so incredibly stressed out if I had to manage my work with any other tool. Using Asana, I've been able to almost eliminate the need for internal email and the ability to work with certain team members on tasks and projects, as well as share tasks across multiple projects has been a game changer for me and my team. I've even been using it for organizing my personal life with my wife and family! Four stars on features because I'd love to see native GANTT integration that doesn't require purchasing a subscription from a third party. THANK YOU ASANA.",3/11/2016,Pros: Everything,"Cons: I find it difficult to see a time-based overview of all the work my team is doing. We're a church so most of the services we provide are different each week, so we don't have a seat project timeline for most of the work we do because it's always changing. Because of this, I struggle to understand the full extent of my teams workload and also struggle to plan ahead for projects because I can't really see what's coming down the pipeline."
527,527 Asana,Asana,Kate M.,"Director, Product Development",Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,10,“Solid task management tool”,"Overall: We use Asana for personal task-tracking, our product backlog, weekly team meeting agendas, and our company retreat agendas. It works well for all three purposes, and Asana continues to release new features that help us work better.",5/10/2016,"Pros: The combination of good task-tracking functionality with some fun personality (such as the Celebration Unicorns, now not just unicorns!). Asana continues to add good new functionality that helps meet our needs--latest additions that have been useful are ""Waiting on..."" to mark task dependencies and Custom Fields.","Cons: Our one problem is that we have to manage some things very procedurally or else tasks can at times get orphaned in other projects. This isn't necessarily a software flaw (the flexibility of multiple projects, etc., is a huge strength), but it does mean a bit more rather than less process to keep the backlog truly all-encompassing."
528,528 Asana,Asana,Timothy O.,Founder,Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Fantastic project management software”,"Overall: I needed a project management tool that organized and streamlined my work, and Asana does exactly that.",27/9/2020,"Pros: Asana is very robust and has loads of features. Being able to view projects many different ways (lists, board/kanban, calendar, etc.) is incredibly convenient.","Cons: I'd like the ability to archive project tasks, similar to how Trello allows you to. It'd also be nice to have the main task be automatically marked as done once all subtasks are completed."
529,529 Asana,Asana,David M.,Software Developer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,5,4,4,9,“I really like it.”,"Overall: Asana has saved me time and resources in my work, adding order and productivity.",23/9/2020,"Pros: Positive points in my experience with Asana: Easy to use and clear user interface. Flexible, with many options for teamwork. Assignment of group tasks and sub-tasks. Visible and private projects for members according to preference. Updates and reminders. Smooth control and management of activities, tasks and projects that are more difficult to supervise with dispersed work. Quick notifications.","Cons: I consider that the functions offered for the paid version (version I currently use) are very basic, so I hope to see more attractive tools over time, because otherwise what would be the point of continuing to pay being able to use the free version that also works very well."
530,530 Asana,Asana,Jasmine G.,"Owner, Interior Designer",Design,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,10,“Love Asana for all my small business needs!”,Overall: I love using Asana and I love being able to collaborate with my team and assign tasks when I need to. It makes it easy to track everything and stay on track for projects.,22/9/2020,Pros: I love all the capabilities that this software has. I switched from Trello for all the comprehensive abilities it has. I only use to free version but am ready to purchase the premium because I think its so worth it especially if you have large teams your managing,"Cons: Learning how to organize things. At first, because there are so many boards, lists, and tasks it can be overwhelming. Especially for new employees that don't understand."
531,531 Asana,Asana,Aman D.,IT Analyst,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,4,5,,5,9,“A handy project management tool to manage all sorts of projects”,Overall: The experience so far has been good specially when compared to MS projects. I believe project management tools still have a long way to go with advancement in AI.,22/9/2020,Pros: The thing that I most like about this software is its integration to other applications such as MS Teams. Multiple templates can be set up for different types of projects to save on time. The tasks are easy to add and modify.,"Cons: The interface can get confusing specially when there are a lot of projects. Even though the application is integrated with other apps, any modification opens up the application in a separate browser instead of the ability to make the changes within another app."
532,532 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Biotechnology,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Best task and project management app/platform”,"Overall: Favorite task management and project management tool for its ease of use, low learning curve to get started, but lots of features to help organize projects and team members and resources",23/7/2020,"Pros: Easy to get started and nice UI. Easy to create new tasks and organize into sub-tasks or projects Easy to include new members and people outside your organization Easy to drag all types of documents into each task Can view tasks and projects in variety of formats like kanban cards, timeline, checklist Provides a great high-level view of projects Lots of new features Can create various projects for a larger project Integrates with a variety of time tracking tools, email, Gantt charts, etc.",Cons: Lack of technical documentation with their API Different tiers of integration Microsoft Teams plug-in is slow

I feel like my head is finally screwed on again, instead of floating all over the place trying desperately to remember which tasks to work on next. It's the best planning system I've ever found. I'm so very grateful. Thank-you from the bottom of my heart.",21/7/2020,"Pros: I love how Asana makes my planningn so tidy and easy to use and sort! I love how I can have different categories in one system, so I can actually plan multiple businesses in one account without having to log out and back in again. I love how I can set each one up so that I have different stages of my planning that are really easy to follow and adjust and share with whoever I need to help me on a different task. I use columns so I can go from idea stage, to planning, to recording, to editing, to publishing, to promoting my YouTube videos, for example. As I go through each stage, I can mark it complete and move it to the next step so easily. It saves me an office full of random post-it notes","Cons: Nothing really! Again, my office is so much tidier now and my work flow is just so much more organized and efficient now. I honestly can't think of any possible improvements."
534,534 Asana,Asana,Madeline M.,Digital Media Planner,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,9,“Makes Sure I Get Everything Done On Time”,Overall:,20/2/2020,"Pros: I honestly love using Asana! It's so detailed, every task and subtask for the day is laid out. It's easy to pass tasks over to other people, it's easy to make notes and attach files when necessary, and it's really easy to add your own fields like ""hours the task will take"" so you have a better picture of how much work you have ahead of you for the day/week and can plan accordingly.","Cons: Because it is so detailed, when task has to be pushed back, there's a ripple effect across the other tasks that then need to be pushed back too. So it takes some project management time to make these types of adjustments. For us, if something had to be pushed back, there were at least 5-10 following tasks we'd have to go in and adjust. If you have to do this a lot, the time adds up."
535,535 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Design,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Great Features”,Overall: I love Asana! I will surelly recommend it to my friends. This is really a big help to our company! I love the features and the interface.,7/2/2020,Pros: I have tons of task to do at work. What I like about Asana is that I can sort my task and it's easier for me to know what's my priority task. I can easily assign tasks to my team members too.,Cons: I cannot think of anything at the moment. I tries different kind of software and so far this is my favorite!
536,536 Asana,Asana,Tanushree G.,Project Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,5,5,4,9,“Coolest task management Tool”,Overall: I would rate my overall experience with Asana to be 8/10,6/1/2020,Pros: I really like the way boards are maintained inside of the individual projects in Asana. It is thus very easy to maintain tasks as per their status/owner/module/epic/etc. You can divide the tasks as per your own convenience.,Cons: Nothing as such. Every provided feature is good. I only wish to have some liberty in moving the order of tasks in a calendar.

538,538 Asana,Asana,Steve L.,Owner,Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Keeps Us Moving and Organized”,Overall: We are able to communicate and collaborate on tasks on our projects with ease. It's a great tool for managing both the tasks to manage my day and a great tool to measure the progress and direction of others on my team.,5/12/2019,"Pros: I like the fact that it's also a great communication feature for team members located in different parts of the country. It's easy to not only manage my personal daily work, but a great tool to allow others to see what I'm doing and contribute.","Cons: I had a period of time (months) where the software would run very slowly on my machine. Other teammates didn't experience the issue, but I would see the issue and have to leave the site/system and return in order to get the necessary response rate. Although the issue appears to have been corrected a few months ago and things work great now."
539,539 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Management Consulting,2+ years,4,3,4,3,3,6,“Struggle to use Asana for multiple project teams”,Overall:,3/12/2019,Pros: Asana's user interface is really nice. It's easy enough to set up projects and to track them and to-dos throughout the projects. I started using it for one single project and then was adding on more projects and more users. I had different users for different projects and it started to get complicated. I liked Asana's accountability tracker and that I could share progress with external stakeholders (I.e. clients) without exposing all of our internal communication.,"Cons: Once it started to get complicated, I didn't find that Asana was great at handling the complexities. It was hard to differentiate what project I was looking at and how to add different users to different projects. While their interface is nice, their user experience could use some work."
540,540 Asana,Asana,Rebecca R.,Software Development Engineer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,4,4,4,10,“Adequate software to carry out the work and the management of projects in teams”,"Overall: I love that this software has been implemented since it is really customizable and it is very useful for us to be able to carry out our tasks in a much more organized way and with a fairly fair workflow for everyone, which helps to make project management really scalable.",25/8/2019,"Pros: Asana has a lot of aspects that make me very attractive, since it has a really intuitive and visually pleasing control panel so navigating through it is not complicated, so it is easy to assign tasks or subtasks and until exchanging files so that moving forward in a project is much easier because we can work as a team and if any change is made we can visualize it all thanks to the fact that there are notifications that spell out this function, it is also possible to observe everything more graphically because We also have a calendar available, this is how using Asana helps both personally and corporately because managing projects is really easy with her.",Cons: Asana usually sends many emails so instead of becoming nice it becomes somewhat suffocating so it would be nice if this is only when important changes are made.
541,541 Asana,Asana,Maria Lenin L.,Business Development,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,5,4,,9,“Task Management Made Easy”,,20/7/2019,,"Cons: So far I am really liking this software. I use it everyday and we collaborate through Asana. No errors, no hanging, all links work perfectly fine. I am definitely to recommend this."
542,542 Asana,Asana,Charlotte D.,Digital Researcher,Leisure,2+ years,4,3,5,,,6,“Overcomplicated”,"Overall: It's useful to work with colleagues on tasks and to view what you need to do. We use it for project management, setting deadlines and writing descriptions of each task. We can also view on the calendar what is happening when, or tasks for certain months. We mark when tasks are completed and it shows us when things have gone over their deadline.",10/7/2019,"Pros: Every feature works very well. You can create, manage and view tasks (with details, deadlines and descriptions) and is super easy to collaborate with colleagues - assigning them tasks and receiving live updates of edits and additions to each task.","Cons: It is overcomplicated. There are too many options, too many lists, it can be quite overwhelming when you have a lot to do. Aesthetically it needs to be re-designed - things are easy to miss because at first glance it is too confusing."
543,543 Asana,Asana,Felippe F.,BI Analyst,Education Management,2+ years,5,5,4,,4,10,“Organize your work and do more with your team”,,16/6/2019,,"Cons: Nothing about usage, really! The paid plan sounded expensive, so we kept for life with the free (but robust) solution. If you have the budget, though, do not think twice"
544,544 Asana,Asana,Sean D.,Partner / COO,Sporting Goods,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“I Recommend Asana daily to others!”,,8/6/2019,,"Cons: The My Task view would be nice to have the ability to save preset displays. For example all my tasks due today and tomorrow only, to keep my focus and view of tasks clean. Then to save a view of my tasks for the next 7 days and the next 30 days. And then all overdue tasks. To me this is helpful to get a fast snapshot of what's due and past due."
545,545 Asana,Asana,Julien E.,Executive Assistant,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“One of the best task manager I've used so far”,"Overall: I've been using asana for more than a year now and it helped me a lot with projects and tasks that I've been working on with my clients. The features are super handy, easy-to-use, integrable to other software (like zapier). I'm still using asana and will definitely stick to it for a long time.",26/4/2019,"Pros: What I like the most with Asana is its multipurpose use. Aside from being able to add tasks and projects, it has its own calendar giving you a preview of what you need to do in a week or month. Aside from that, it has the ""File"" tab where you're able to save files associated with any tasks you are working on. I also love how Asana sorts tasks as Today, Due Soon, or In a week. Helps me set my mindset on what is the priority.","Cons: There's really nothing much I hate about this software. Maybe just the delay when you are completing a task. I usually have to wait for the unicorn to disappear before I close the tab where I use asana (or else, the task I tagged as completed stay due)"
546,546 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Medical Devices,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Great for personal and workplace project management”,"Overall: We are able to collaborate on projects between departments and know what part of the project each person is at without having to check in with each other so much, which saves time overall.",16/1/2019,"Pros: I like how easy it is to create tasks, groups, and assign those tasks. I love that you can look at each project as a task list or easily switch to the calendar view and even add things to boards like Trello. Overall, considering that I'm only using this as a free program the value is amazing.","Cons: I think there isn't much I don't like. The features are little overkill if you're a new user or just need this for simple task management like a to-do list, but if you're looking for robust project management, this is really the best app for that purpose, especially in a creative workplace or new business."
547,547 Asana,Asana,Kaitlin T.,Yoga Instructor,Real Estate,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“I love it as an office manager!”,,15/1/2019,,"Cons: Hmmm, the cons are harder for me to think of. I guess I would like to see a ""chat"" option within asana. And maybe even a ""live"" version would be cool. (similar to google docs, the way you can see the other person typing live.) Otherwise, I don't have a whole lot of negative things to say"
548,548 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Commercial Real Estate,2+ years,4,4,4,1,3,9,“Interesting Tool”,Overall: My overall experience with Asana has been positive and I would recommend as a starting project management tool.,28/11/2018,"Pros: What I like most about this tool is that you can create projects and assign them while setting deadlines. Further, they recently changed the previously useless Home section which now acts as a dashboard. However, something is wrong with their algorithm as it has as my ""favorite"" the project I least access. Odd. Also, they offer a pretty decent tool at the basic level.","Cons: What I like least about this software is that it doesn't let me easily find the tasks assigned to a specific team member. I actually have to go to a project and click on the team member. It should be made accessible to the Admin through the Home page/dashboard. Also, the threads can sometimes be a bit of a mess with the most recent posts being at the end of the thread so you have to scroll down instead of them being at the top so you can see where you are now. I don't really see the benefit to their Premium tool. I had the Premium level and had no real increase in efficiency or capability that made a difference."
549,549 Asana,Asana,Ben C.,Digital Marketing Manager,Entertainment,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“I LOVE asana - wonderful project management platform”,Overall: Fantastic task and project management tool. We utilize it for managing art requests and love it.,20/11/2018,"Pros: I love how effectively asana helps you to keep complex projects in a simple and easy to edit to-do list. We primarily use asana to create and manage our design projects back-and-forth (requests for design, designers first drafts, approvals, and delivery), and the ability to assign tasks and manage them on a timeline is extremely helpful.","Cons: adding increasingly complex tasks can be a bit much for asana's display. you can ad dub-tasks within subtasks if you want to, but it's clearly not defigned to go that ""deep"" within a single ""task"". this can be addressed by entering your tasks under a larger ""project"" but might not suit everyones preferred working style."
550,550 Asana,Asana,Sarah Bernardina B.,Owner,Information Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,“Best Project Management Tool”,Overall: This is what we used in our team to monitor all the projects we have on hand. Its very helpful to us to keep each and everyone moving forward.,6/11/2018,"Pros: It is so very easy to use. It's quick to add new tasks and sections. The integration with Slack is also very nice because we could create tasks in slack and it reflects directly on Asana. The calendar view is also good, assigning the tasks and dates are also very helpful on dealing with the tasks. The additional fields are also very useful to extend whatever extra information is needed with the Project. The dependency feature is also very very helpful. Our team really liked it because we able to monitor the tasks we have for the Project.","Cons: So far, the only the thing that I encounter is when assigning a task to the same person. We needed to split the tasks or duplicate it just to make sure that the task should be done by both. But overall, for our team we 100% utilizing it."
551,551 Asana,Asana,Thamara P.,Gerente de desarrollo de aplicaciones y servicio al cliente,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,5,4,4,3,7,“ Agile project management”,"Overall:  It has allowed us to improve communication management during projects. As well as, having a site with the shared elements for the development of the project. All the development and infrastructure team are as users of this tool, in the particular management of each area and in the synergy of these",13/8/2018,"Pros:  In agile projects it is essential to have a tool adjusted to the needs of immediate communication, this is why Assana allows: - * Add activities and estimated duration times - * dashboard project summary - * visualize the activities assigned to the user or others. depending on the role of each user within the panel - * traceability of the project: between the ounicación and sent elements - * Add labels according to status -*Easy to use - * attach elements as evidence of any information These have been the most favorable points in my use of the tool, Assana","Cons:  In assana it would be of added value to allow the printing of progress reports, as well as calendar. This allows us to deliver reports to sponsors and involuntary projects. To be able to integrate this tool with other applications such as a variety of repositories"
552,552 Asana,Asana,karan v.,Senior Software Developer,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,4,5,4,8,“A great tool for managing of tasks for small teams”,Overall: We used it for task management and project management in our daily needs. It created great workflow for our company where we can easily assign tasks to everyone. It helped to keep track of development.,8/8/2018,"Pros: All the problems are planned in detail with the help of Asana. Everyone loves the joint tasks, which can be put into small sections and have their own tags which you want it to have. You can easily invite more people to work on your projects by using the email. With many access levels for the employees working on same project, Asana is simply great. We can manage our time properly and transfer small tasks scheduling days with simple by drag and drop option. It helps in keeping the projects on track. The help team of Asana is always so ready to help customers.","Cons: I would like more faster behaviour in Asana, also we can have more functionalities in the android application. We need to have more third party integrations with Asana."

554,554 Asana,Asana,Rabeah A.,Lead Web Developer,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“The central hub for our in-house project management”,"Overall: It keeps our marketing team and development team in sync with one another, and helps keep us on track with completing tasks on time for our clients.",20/2/2018,"Pros: After going through multiple pieces of project management software, our company of about 10 settled on asana to keep track of tasks. It gives us the flexibility to oversee the project from a macro and micro level clearly, which is great for keeping managers and developers/designers on the same page. In addition to that, app integration with Slack, Zapier, and Google Drive make communication and file management a breeze, and Zapier helps automate a few things within asana and google drive. Also really enjoyed the built-in time tracking, which helps make sure that deliverables are completed within a reasonable timeframe. There is also a mobile app and calendar integration to make sure that even on the go, you are aware of whats on your schedule.","Cons: I wish there was a way to customize the interface a bit more. I use the app daily, and the intense white background can be a bit much. A dark UI option would be fantastic."
555,555 Asana,Asana,Donyelle K.,Online Account Executive,Unspecified,2+ years,4,5,4,5,4,10,“Makes staying on task and working as a team easy!”,Overall: Team accountability. Organization of work. Collaborative abilities among our team. Ability to track work hours and integrate easily with our log system.,29/12/2017,Pros: Being able to add multiple team members to tasks to keep everyone updated on status and responsibilities is awesome! Having the ability to set deadlines and view other team members tasks is a great way to keep everyone accountable to the work we are delivering. I also love that we can share documents and it easily integrates with our time logging software to keep track of our work hours.,"Cons: Often times if I'm tagged in task that needs my attention it can get lost if I'm not constantly searching my inbox or if it's not directly assigned to me. If you are an individual or team with a lot of work going on it's hard to seek these out immediately. However, the email notifications I get from Asana when something is in my court help to sort through these making this not as much of a software flaw but user flaw."
556,556 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Professional Training & Coaching,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Great 'To-Do' List for Teams”,Overall: It's a great tool for keeping up and interacting with team projects. It's very powerful with what all it can do. It may be too much for some teams or an individual just looking to keep track of daily tasks.,28/10/2017,"Pros: I first discovered Asana years ago when working on a team with several projects going on all at once. It's a great tool to see all projects at once, assign specific team members to a task, set due dates, reminders, and so much more. You can comment or ask questions within a task. You can see when an item was completed, notes, and everything in between. When I moved to a different company, they were usin Excel spreadsheet to keep up with tasks and I suggested we use Asana instead. As someone who loves task lists and being able to check off items off a to-do list, this is a great tool.",
557,557 Asana,Asana,Chris F.,"Regional Facility Manager, IT & Marketing",Sports,2+ years,5,5,4,5,3,10,“A game changer for any company”,"Overall: Asana has been a game changer for our company. We coordinate many levels of staff over multiple locations, and use the software as a primary communication and project management tool. It has allowed us to work closely with our entire management staff on a daily basis without the need for scheduling meetings, time consuming conference calls, or commuting across the city. We also use it to manage and track staff duties at each location. Everyone who has used the software has loved it.",10/11/2016,"Pros: Ability to communicate and coordinate projects, tasks, and follow-up.","Cons: Some ""wish list"" features, being able to assign multiple people to a single task, more options for repeating tasks and sub-tasks, task trees that would clearly show sub-tasks in multiple depths at once, Google calendar integration, etc."
558,558 Asana,Asana,Brandi B.,Art Director,Internet,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,10,“Asana for Indispensable Task & Project Management”,"Overall: I use Asana every day and it keeps me sane! I use it for my general daily to-do list, but also higher level business (and personal!) plans and projects. For the daily tasks, the recurring task feature is brilliant and easy to use. I have things in there that recur only once per year, I'd totally forget about them if it weren't for Asana! I keep things grouped in different teams and projects. I am able to color code these teams/projects in such a way that when I view my tasks on a global calendar, I can easily see what I have going on, with the clear visual color cues. It's a wonderful tool for mapping out a large project and then breaking it down into components and tasks that can be spread out over time and across various team members. I am able to brain dump everything I can think of easily, then sort the tasks in ways that make it approachable. I've been using Asana for just over a year, and I can't imagine life without it. They keep adding new features and improving their service. I am very pleased.",3/11/2016,"Pros: They keep improving functionality. I love the recurring tasks, teams & projects, color coding, & custom labels.",Cons: The phone app could be improved.
559,559 Asana,Asana,David H.,Lead Marketing Programmer,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,3,4,4,,8,“Great Tracking Tool for your tasks”,"Overall: Very good. I am learning things on Asana every week and if you keep things clean, you can make things easier for yourself. I like the templates that you can use for any tasks for different clients. You can also share the tasks with clients.",10/11/2020,Pros: Good tracking tool for tasks and to assign and reassign to others and to keep things organize with individuals and groups,"Cons: Can be a learning curve but the videos do help. Also, I am still wondering if there is a bulk feature on tasks that are similar that you can edit all at one time. Speaking of videos, the one of the people that made the videos had their opinion on a specific group. I rather if they focus more on the the product instead of showing their opinion in the background, keep it clean please."
560,560 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Design,2+ years,4,4,4,,,7,“Great Project Management for a Remote Team”,"Overall: Our team works fully remote and project management is critical to our workflow. Asana helps us in those areas of the business. It is one of the webpages I open, and keep open, daily. Asana is where we get our assignments and also tick-off these projects to keep things well-organized.",5/11/2020,"Pros: What I like about Asana is the clear way of presenting future and on-going projects. As a fully remote team, project management is a key element in running our business. It helps us track what each individual is doing so we won't have overlaps in our duties. It is also beneficial in organizing bigger projects and then creating and assigning subtask for them.","Cons: I joined the team that was already fully running Asana and it took a bit of time for me to adjust to the workflow. But once I got the hang of it, it was easy and useful for me and the team."
561,561 Asana,Asana,Jessica R.,Co-Founder + Marketing Strategist,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Excellent Collaboration and Task/Project Management ”,Overall: It helped us create and assign tasks for ourselves and team members. Multiple project views are helpful. It's easy to bring in freelancers and assign/track tasks.,20/10/2020,"Pros: Asana is highly intuitive and easy to use. The built-in gamification features are amusing, but more importantly it's an excellent way to manage tasks, projects, and collaborate across teams.","Cons: Integration with our existing business processes was a challenge, but that was more the result of dysfunctional internal processes than an issue with Asana itself."

It's nice to look at the tasks I have for the day or week in a manner that doesn't have me scrolling so much or doing a lot to gain access to a task. The templates for projects help immensely too.,Cons: Nothing as of yet. I moved to this software from a prior one and found this to be more superior for what I'm looking for in this type of product.

Highly recommend,26/3/2020,Pros: The visuals and organization of this software are great. No detail is spared and it makes progress updates & tracking incredibly smooth.,"Cons: There's no IM option, which could help improve communication about a project. The ""comments"" section only sends notifications to your email and that gets messy."
566,566 Asana,Asana,Jake H.,CEO,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,3,4,3,4,7,“Great Project Management Tool for Small to Medium-Sized Businesses”,Overall: We're currently not using Asana as much as we would like to because of the due date issue. It causes us a lot of unnecessary work that can be rudimentarily covered by a Google doc with our small agency.,9/2/2020,"Pros: The layout of it made it easy to understand and see what projects needed to be accomplished and when. It was really easy to set up projects and tasks, even subtasks and add notes to each project.","Cons: There are two things. You can't use template projects in the free version and you can't set automatic project deadlines for duplicated projects or through templates. Typically our projects have a 30-45 day completion time limit. It would be nice to be able to create a project off of a specific template and have the due dates for each task auto-fill 'x' amount of days or weeks out. It can be quite a pain to update all due dates in all of your tasks and subtasks, especially if you have larger projects like website builds."
567,567 Asana,Asana,Greg R.,Ux Designer,Design,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“Works Great”,Overall: We used multiple other systems before deciding on Asana. We have been satisfied with it ever since.,6/2/2020,Pros: Great interface. Easy to Use. Various task views. I am able to manage all of the tasks assigned to me easily.,Cons: I am not able to set a project view based on what I prefer. It is always the same for the whole team. If I like list view and someone likes board view then we are out of luck.

Asana cleaned up my inbox and reduced the number of meetings and requests from my team significantly. I felt a greater sense of control in my life and business. Thanks, Asana","Cons: Not the best onboarding or marketing. You don't know why you need this until you do. Their NY Times half page ad was obtuse, such is the life of a Venture driven software company. I hope they stay in business, but they could really use me to help explain to prospects why they need this stuff and not a bunch of Dev engineers who are largely marginalized at startups."

What I like most about this software is that it connects with my Google Drive so that I can access my documents quickly and I can also sub-categorize my tasks.","Cons: The mobile version is still not as useful to me as the desktop version, but that's a minimal pain point since I'm usually working on my desktop."

574,574 Asana,Asana,Mary W.,Director of Foundation Relations,Higher Education,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“Effective Task Reminder”,,18/11/2019,,"Cons: There is some workplace psychology that goes into this software, and it can feel overwhelming or make you feel guilty if you don't accomplish everything that you intended to in a single day. It would be helpful if this software made changing deadlines more guilt free by suggesting new deadlines around the end of the workday."

It works great on desktop and with the mobile app. Can't really complain because we are using the free version,"Cons: The functionality can be intimidating to the everyday user, but it's a powerful software which can be customized many ways to maximize your workflow."
576,576 Asana,Asana,Meliksah T.,Engineer,Consumer Electronics,2+ years,4,4,5,3,4,8,“Fine project management sofware that you can manage tasks in a hierarchical structure”,"Overall: We are relatively a small engineering team that does R&D for Production. We have a lot of projects to keep track of, most of which we outsource. Since they are numerous, we needed an app the manage all the tasks. We started using Asana and we're content so far. It offers good UI and performance, as well as sub-tasks management and most importantly perhaps, the Gannt scheme.",6/9/2019,Pros: - Good UI - Ability to create and manage sub-tasks in hierarchical way - Way of communication it enables between teammates - A well designed Gannt scheme - Cost efficient,Cons: Only con that I can think of is that everyone can assign tasks to everyone and everyone is able to close these tasks. Perhaps it would be better for only the project manager to close a task after checking whether the task is actually and accurately completed or not.
577,577 Asana,Asana,Alainna B.,Program Manager,Political Organization,2+ years,5,3,5,,,9,"“Out with the old, in with Asana”","Overall: Asana comes in handy every day at our organization, where many people plug in on different projects at their own pace.",29/7/2019,"Pros: Asana was a clear choice for us when we decided to move on from our previous task management software. Rather than giving only the option to create individual, simplistic tasks, Asana presents a world of opportunities with creating entire projects, within which individual tasks can be assigned to people across all sections of our team. The functionality is top notch, for any need that arises.","Cons: There was definitely a learning curve, and folks from the team were more comfortable with our former task management software, so the switch wasn't easy. The sheer amount of capabilities that Asana has is definitely a positive thing, but take care to educate the entire team as much as possible to eliminate the learning curve."
578,578 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Excellent project managment tool”,"Overall: I've been using this software for years and it's one of the best project management tools out there. The main feature I like is that you can have multiple workspaces that have multiple projects, that have multiple tasks, that can have multiple sub tasks.",5/5/2019,"Pros: This software is free and easy to use. You can have multiple Workspaces and projects inside those work spaces and then tasks, giving you many ways to organise your work and projects. It's simple to use and has a web interface or mobile app.",Cons: The mobile app can be a little hard to navigate for advanced features but works fine for tasks and project work.
579,579 Asana,Asana,April S.,Virtual Assistant,Management Consulting,2+ years,4,4,4,,4,8,“Great way to keep track of work tasks”,Overall: My overall experience with Asana is great. I use it mainly for communicating tasks to and from clients and coworkers. I'm mostly on the receiving end of the tasks and I really like the way the layout of the task page is. I also use the inbox feature almost daily and find that it is sometimes faster than sending an email because I'm already in the program.,27/4/2019,"Pros: What I like most about Asana is that it keeps me organized, and once you figure out how to use it, it is pretty easy to use. I am very project based with my work and being able to check off tasks on my list as completed, is very satisfying. It is also awesome for working with a virtual team, or with clients who are in a differnet location than you are. I like the tasks and inbox functions the best and how everything is so easy to use from the beginning. I also like when I have tasks assigned to me, I get an email notification in my gmail.","Cons: There is not too much that I don't like about this software. I can't think of any negatives really. It took a little bit to learn how to use it, but the instructions and help feature are really useful."

It's is probably one of the nicer apps I have seen. Not only that, but it is also super functional, too. You have the ability to not only track your own progress on a number of different projects, but also are able to track other peoples on your team as well. Adding in new tasks, and notifying others on progress is also very simple to do.","Cons: There really aren't any major issues that I have with this at all. If anything , there are just nitpicky improvements. Maybe have more documentation and a ""how-to"" pop up for new users. I know for me, when I first started using this app, there seemed like a lot of options - which was a little overwhelming. eventually I figured it out, but it did take me some time to learn. So maybe a quick tutorial on the features will be helpful."
581,581 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Health,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,“Great Task Platform for Organizing & Projects”,"Overall: I think Asana is a great tool to keep projects and tasks organized. Once you learn how to use it, it's very easy to create tasks/projects, assign & add due dates, track progress (micro & macro level), and complete assignments. I love how detailed the organization can get by creating subtasks within larger tasks. Asana is also helpful to use with people outside of your company; we collaborate with partner companies and individual contractors outside of our organization, making it easy for everyone to stay on track. Plus there are little surprises you can add to your Asana account that make using it a bit more fun, because who doesn't need a unicorn to fly across the screen when you complete enough tasks?",16/4/2019,"Pros: ability to organize tasks/projects on different levels, easy to assign/transfer tasks, easy to monitor progress or projects on a task basis as well as overall, customization options include colors & custom fields","Cons: a bit of a learning curve to figure out the software for new users, but once you get the hang of it it's very easy to use"
582,582 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Publishing,2+ years,5,5,5,,4,9,“Asana Keeps Things from Slipping Through the Cracks”,"Overall: We had multiple departments-often 5 or 6-all involved in projects that involved cross-departmental work. Before Asana, the best tool we had for communicating across departments was Asana. Asana increased communication and collaboration five-fold on our team, all-the-while cutting down on the time required for these things. Highly recommend.",12/2/2019,Pros: I like the ability to organize a complete project start to finish. It helps so much to know what tasks I need to do each day as I come into work and to look ahead to what is coming up in the future. This has been a game changer for running projects in a team environment where there are multiple stakeholders.,"Cons: There is a little bit of a learning curve, and some of the tools used to show different views of a project take some time to get acquainted with. Overall, these add value, but the tradeoff is more complexity, and if you are not familiar with a view used by a project lead, it can be confusing at first."
583,583 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer & Network Security,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“My Favorite Project Management Software ”,Overall: I LOVE Asana and continue urging more teams across our company to implement it.,12/1/2019,Pros: My favorite part about Asana is the ability to look back years in the past to see what was completed on which day. It makes it incredibly easy to store information and documents across my team to keep everyone on track and make sure that projects are being completed on time.,"Cons: One thing I wish Asana had was the ability to assign someone as a supervisor to another so that they have the ability to see everything in their ""my tasks"" without the task being assigned to a specific project. If I could easily see everything my direct reports are working on in one space, I could have a better understanding of their project load without direct communication."
584,584 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Great for small businesses”,"Overall: I was working for a small business with around 10 people --- and we didn't have time to be helicopter-managing, have a formal project manager, or reminding people what to do. Asana would help us accomplish our goals.",30/10/2018,"Pros: I liked having everything in one place, with an intuitive design and the ability to prioritize by assigning ONE key person per task. It really helped with accountability so tasks would actually take place. I also liked that it helped me not have to handhold creatives and remind them all the time what to do. Asana would let them know.","Cons: I liked it because I was responsible for moving projects along and assigning the tasks -- but for creatives, it was really ah ""ugh"" tool. Partly because they would rather not have structure or project organizers."
585,585 Asana,Asana,Rohit L.,Marketing Manager,Computer & Network Security,2+ years,4,5,4,5,4,8,“Project board of our Organization”,,25/8/2018,,"Cons: Inability to see all the tasks in one place from other workspaces. Subtask view is difficult - I agree that adding subtasks make the view less cluttered but when assignees are different for each subtask, they are clueless about parent task. Notifications and task view doesn't name the parent which created problems for their understanding."
586,586 Asana,Asana,Niraj P.,Product Specialist,11-50 employees,2+ years,5,4,4,4,3,8,“Asana is an amazing productivity tool”,"Overall: The foremost being increased productivity. I can now see which tasks is at what stage currently. Various assets and updates in each task or project are collected at the same place - since asana provides loads of integrations, the most number of third party integrations amongst any project management tool.",11/7/2018,"Pros: The best part of asana is that its interface is fairly simple to use and gives apt feedback on taking any action. The mobile app works very well - offline as well. They keep on developing new useful features such as project templates, timeline and their response on the product feedback is also good.","Cons: There aren't a lot of things that I dislike about asana. One thing being that it is not possible to sort the tasks under 'my tasks' according to my sorting parameter. another thing that can be improved is flexibility - it has too much flexibility - since everyone can setup their projects, tasks and subtasks in various way, it becomes difficult to compare two entities. It'd be better to have some level of standardization. But again, such a requirement can differ from company to company."
587,587 Asana,Asana,Stephanie G.,Art Director,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,9,“My team productivity increased by 70% after we started using Asana to manage our in-house projects”,,11/5/2018,,Cons: There is not a lot that I don't like about Asana. They always roll out new features. There are some small stuff that I wish they'd improve like the ability to add your own way to sort your own Tasks and maybe ability to track time spend in a tasks inside the app with out having to get another tool like time doctor.

They've been great about adding new features and constantly making the software better. I've been using Asana for years (as a free user) and through many events we've organized and client projects. The creation of projects is super easy, and each task has all the features you would need (due dates, subtasks, attachments to google docs, comments, etc). They have good tutorials to help explain new subjects.","Cons: It's still hard to get people on board, but I think that happens with all new programs. For people to really get benefit from asana, it requires a bit of time to learn the features also."

You can get notifications for when things are due or completed, but if you have multiple projects it can be hard to keep track of everything. When a coworker leaves a comment, it's easy to miss it and that can delay things."
591,591 Asana,Asana,Gareth M.,Managing Director,Consumer Goods,2+ years,4,3,5,4,5,9,“Excellent tool that has a lot of functionality for free - great for a small business”,Overall: Great project management,15/2/2018,"Pros: I run a small business, and Asana is ideal for managing our projects. We might have about 15 projects on the go at any one time, with 10-20 tasks per project, 2 users. At this level it is free to use, yet feature rich. We use it partly as a dumping ground for ideas using the web interface, web app or emailed in directly, which can be sorted at a later date into the relevant projects.","Cons: The interface could do with some work. They seem to have gone for style over substance in a lot of places - for example on a small screen (I use a Surface 3), some scrollbars have been deliberately hidden for style purposes and you cannot scroll over to see your data. You need to zoom your browser out to be able to see it all."
592,592 Asana,Asana,Justin L.,Marketing Operations Manager,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,5,5,4,,5,9,“Excellent PM Software for Most Teams”,"Overall: At first we just needed a PM software to manage marketing campaign development. After seeing how easy it is to use and how much it streamlined our processes, we expanded its use into larger projects and cross-team projects. We especially like it's calendar, templates, and board visualization features.",15/2/2018,"Pros: Asana is a great, lightweight, easy to use project management software platform. Great visualizations and an intuitive interface. What's best that it's constantly being developed and catching up with or overtaking the functionality of its competitors.","Cons: So far it lacks some of the fine-tuned PM granularity of more robust platforms, such as multi-level task dependencies. But, to be honest, most projects and organizations don't need that and/or such functionality can actually over-complicate things."
593,593 Asana,Asana,Shelly H.,Director of Business Analytics,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“Asana is the type of tool that once you start using it you'll find yourself going back to it daily ”,Overall: Asana is great for helping keep yourself organized and keeping your team's work organized.,11/1/2018,"Pros: Asana is excellent at task tracking. I am a major 'to do list' person and I used Asana to manage my own work, my team's work, and projects. Asana allows tasks to be kept private and be shared with individuals or groups. It also allows for sub-tasks to be created and custom fields to be used to track project specific metrics. My team relied heavily on Asana and adoption was easy for new users.","Cons: I didn't have a lot of issues with Asana while using it. The only feature that I found myself wishing was available that wasn't was shared tasks. Currently, tasks can only be assigned to one individual and not be shared between more than one person or a group."
594,594 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Research,2+ years,4,4,4,4,5,10,“Brain Saver”,"Overall: I have two roles at my job, for my ""lower-priority"" role I am the only person responsible for maintaining a list of content updates, errors, new pages, design improvements, and whatever else we might want to do with our website, as well as contacting our vendor and making sure our projects keep moving forward. I tried to use outlook and paper to organize my tasks, but every time, my primary role would get an influx of work, and when I'd go back to web work, I'd get overwhelmed all over again. Asana has amazing options for manipulating each task are incredible and are close to exactly how I would have hoped they would be. It is really laid out well visually (thanks, in part to the section headers), so, being a visual person, I can easily find the task I'm looking for, even in lists of 30 items. This has saved me a lot of time and confusion that would result in endless task list reorganizing before Asana. Being able to have one task in multiple projects really helps when I am unsure about organization or need to report on the progress to multiple teams. Prioritization is so much easier now. If I am too busy for anything, I feel like now, I at least know which balls I'm dropping, even if I don't have time for them. The fact that it's free, means I could implement it for myself without having to get management or accounting to go along with it. And now, my manager has a way to track my progress if he wants to.",14/7/2017,"Pros: Free, easy-to-use, versatile sorting options, search, drag and drop, unlimited projects, e-mail reminders","Cons: Subtasks don't display tags when viewing the parent task, task window can't be expanded further, print is hard to find and clunky, I have to use tags to set the status of each task before ""complete"""

It makes workflow run so much more smoothly between departments and my coworkers, and it keeps all my ""to-dos"" in one place. The only qualm I have has more to do with me than the platform. I feel like it's not the most intuitive, and that because I don't know how to use it to it's full extent that I'm just wasting the potential. My next step is finding some quick tips videos or something so I can really get the hang of it.",3/11/2016,"Pros: I like that it's easy to see my ""to-do list"" and organize it by what's not done yet. Plus it's nice to be able to see what other people have on their lists so we can keep track of department productivity and share tasks if someone is falling behind. And I love the little animations that pop up when I've completed a few tasks","Cons: The layout can get a little confusing. Sometimes I accidently upload my docs to the wrong task within a project because of a miss-click, or I accidentally check the project done when it should have been just the task. It can happen so easily if you aren't careful. But again, that could just be me and I need to use the platform a bit more to really understand it's nuances."
596,596 Asana,Asana,Daan B.,Corporate Partnerships Director,Education Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana helps us to get organized and more productive ”,Overall: We use Asana as our main internal communication tool for everything that is actionable. Our organization is built on Holacracy and our roles and OKR's are defined in Asana. This makes Asana the most valuable tool for our company among the 200+ tools we use. Within Asana it is easy to start projects and add tasks. It is easy to delegate and the communication strings are very clear. Besides professionally I use Asana private as well. It gives me more insight in what I need to do and what has my priority. In combination with 'Getting Thins Done' of David Allen Asana is a wonderful tool to get 'in control'.,3/11/2016,Pros: Its intuitive navigation and the way communication works.,Cons: That it is not possible to make projects in projects.

While I understand the idea of collaboration there are is a need to of a higher level of security between teams/projects. The warnings available on the web version are not the same as the mobile app version. There needs to be better protection. There also, needs to be better integration between the tasks and sub tasks dating. The next due date for the product should be linked and based on any sub task due date.",3/11/2016,"Pros: Easy to use and understand, Mobile App",Cons: Security and better separation of members on various teams.

If you have a specific need, you can search along the several plugins in the market which can satisfy any activity with a low budget.",13/10/2020,Pros: Very easy to setup and deploy along your team. Manage several projects without lose your head. Easy to track the progress of each project along teams.

Of note, it is a great, simple tool for meeting organizers to set an agenda and assign tasks to do. Additionally, it is incredibly useful when rolling out a complicated project with deadlines and many people involved.",Cons: Our primary critique with Asana is that it is hard to remove projects from a user's view which tends to bring clutter to what is supposed to bring organization and clarity.
600,600 Asana,Asana,Stephanie D.,VP of Marketing,Retail,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Project Collaboration Game Changer!”,Overall: Our work flow has been 100% changed via Asana. Projects are no longer forgotten about and you can see who is working on what at any time. You can also send reminders or ask for updates from the person currently working on any given project. Asana was a complete game changer and keeps everyone on task,6/10/2020,"Pros: I love being able to start a project in Asana and immediately have my team available to collab with. It's so easy to track projects without going through email threads to try and figure out at what point a project was left off. All projects are also live in applicable flows until done, so you can see all projects being worked on at a glance. It's great to be able to do your portion of the project and assign to someone else instantly to then do their portion.",Cons: I have not experienced any cons with Asana yet!

Chaque tâche peut être assignée à une personne, avoir une date de fin, avoir des followers, chaque membre peut mettre des commentaires, ajouter des fichiers, ... Il est ainsi facile de savoir ce que chacun doit faire chaque semaine.","Cons: Il y aurait encore quelques améliorations à faire, c'est pourquoi je n'ai pas mis 5 étoiles. Il serait bien de classer plus facilement et de voir les attributs ajoutés dans la liste de toutes les tâches même quand une tâche est ouverte. Mais dans l'ensemble, c'est très bien :)"

I received respect and good feedback for the Asana projects I created for my team. I am still waiting for some features to be deployed that in my opinion will make it better.,21/6/2020,"Pros: Asana seems to be constantly evolving and providing more functionality for different types of departments and roles in the company. I tried Asana 4 years ago, and the project I was working on didn't require to much stakeholder and team management. Asana was not there yet. This all changed 6 months ago, when I need a tool to track incidents for my team and managed to learn on my own and slowly build a project that does just that.","Cons: It's really hard to get other colleagues to organise their daily work around Asana. Too many email notifications, makes them turn the Asana notifications off. The ""My Task"" section which supposed to show you all tasks for today is not something a person would be familiar with - hard to find the place and they way to get proper alerts for what is really needs to be done."

Asana helps project members in teams stay informed of the progress made by other team members.It is also an essential tool for team leaders to manage individual tasks required to complete projects. Asana is a very user friendly resource that is very easy to use by most individuals who dont require any training at all to use it.,"Cons: I have found that asana may be too simple of a tool to handle big tasks and projects.While it works very well for small projects, it may lack the sophistication needed and found in bigger software like microsoft project and the likes."

Asana is the perfect platform to clearly and easily see multiple streams of projects and timelines of assignments for all users, connecting everyone to one place where collaboration can happen in real-time.","Cons: The only complaint I can think of that I have encountered when using Asana is having to log in frequently which may disrupt changes that I make during the course of a day. In other words, there have been times where I have been actively updating a project and due to inactivity I have had to log back in, effectively erasing the partial updates I've made to a project."

Sorted out and clear to utilize. I used to be effectively prepared to perceive what undertakings were as yet should have been done and was prepared to keep tabs on my development.",1/4/2020,Pros: I love how organized the team can be using Asana. I even have been utilizing it while working with an advancement group and it simply made our lives simpler. I truly like the ability to impart undertakings to colleagues and allocate assignments/subtasks on to other people. It makes arranging an undertaking extraordinarily proficient and streamlined.,Cons: Reconciliation of email and out of entryways document stockpiling. it may be simpler in the event that we were prepared to see the reinforcement records of my associates. I feel it's planned okay and highlights an excellent interface.
612,612 Asana,Asana,Rebecca B.,Marketing Director,Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Best Project Management tool for Remote Teams”,Overall: Our team is much more organized! I love the ability to make tasks dependent on other tasks so the team can see where there may be a bottleneck.,19/3/2020,Pros: I switched from Trello to Asana and it was a game changer for us! I love that tasks can be set to be recurring. It's easy to see all of your tasks in one place across the different projects. Our entire team is much more organized thanks to Asana.,Cons: There's very little that I dislike about Asana. All of it is great. Any problems we have it with is more a lack of our own organization or keeping up with tasks than the software itself.
613,613 Asana,Asana,Jay D.,Ceo,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,3,3,4,8,“Great entry level tall management”,Overall: My company used Asana for 2 years and loved by it planner. We left about a year ago for a much more expensive program because they had some features the team needs,27/10/2019,Pros: Asana I'd easy to use and administer. Managing tasks does not require additional process and everything is kept in the customer file.,"Cons: In it's ease of use, Asana falls short on higher end project management features. But for the money it's perfect."

You cannot afford to not be organized in realtime with your sales team.",8/10/2019,Pros: I use it on a daily basis to organize my team. You can assign/delegate tasks and keep the ball rolling.,"Cons: It can be slow; specially if you're on a celular network with poor coverage. Also, there is no native app."

It keeps us on task and has a ton of integrations into other softwares we use like Harvest. It allows the project managers to easily check in on to do list items without having to search back through email responses. It's also great for the individual user to be able to prioritize their tasks for the day, week, etc.",Cons: It can be a little tricky to learn all the functionalities of the software just because there are so many options. But there are great tutorials Asana provides to help you navigate all the possibilities.

It has helped me stay organized and lower my stress.,17/9/2019,"Pros: For someone that always has an ongoing to-do list, I'm grateful for Asana. I use it everyday to make sure that I'm up to date on projects, deadlines, and tasks. I really like that you can assign tasks to other colleagues within the organization so that everyone is on the same page. It has plenty of features such as excel format, printing your tasks/projects, and even a recovery option if you accidentally need to find something again after completing it. We use the free version at our organization and it's been a life saver for me. The best part...my desk isn't covered in to do lists and sticky notes.","Cons: There is an initial learning curve for using the program. For example, when creating projects and assigning team members tasks, there seemed to be confusion from colleagues as they received an email alert. Some didn't like this as it cluttered up their email inbox."

You'll never forget an appointment or deadline again You can easily followup on where your team is at on a project Great for working with others remotely or close together Has Gantt style timeline Has trello or Jira style views Lots of ways of managing notifications and communicating with team Zapier integrations",Cons: The form functionality could be better Portfolios don't seem to do much
618,618 Asana,Asana,Adriano F.,freelancer,Design,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,10,“Great tool for projects management”,,25/7/2019,,Cons: 1) Absence of a native platform timer 2) No fields for financial information to calculate the cost of each task.

620,620 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Banking,2+ years,5,4,4,4,5,8,“Asana helps me organize my notes and tasks better!”,"Overall: I have been continuously using it because it helped me a lot - same goes with my team, we use it to check each other's tasks and notes and the current progress of a certain task. It's very effective and worth it",9/6/2019,"Pros: It is very convenient and easy to use, you don't have to allocate a huge amount of time studying/trying to learn how to navigate and use the software. It helps our team in organizing our notes and the tasks that we currently have on the pipe, since you are able to see what your colleague is currently working, you'll know immediately the level of priority and their workloads. It is easier to track all the tasks you've completed and it helps a lot in setting your own deadlines","Cons: This software won't allow you to retrieve the tasks you've deleted, so if you accidentally delete a task, you're given a few seconds to undo it but if you miss it, you lose that data."
621,621 Asana,Asana,byron a.,Sr Dir Marketing Operations,Publishing,2+ years,4,4,3,4,4,7,"“Good platform, but for specific uses”","Overall: Pleased, if not overwhelmed. It is not too expensive for what you get, although I feel they are rather stingy with the seat licenses. For comparable cost, we could use another platform and have unlimited users. However, transitioning workflows would be difficult when things don't currently feel broken.",15/5/2019,Pros: New users are able to adapt quickly as it is intuitive to most people. The layout makes sense and you can find the needed info quickly. I also like the settings to calibrate email notifications.,"Cons: It can feel rather use specific- the templates/format are geared toward creative teams/projects, but it did not have any review capabilities until recently (and it is not robust). We have adapted it across several LOBs and workflows, but it is not overly customizable."
622,622 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,3,5,,,6,“Asana doesn't work great for software teams”,,24/4/2019,,"Cons: They recently rolled out a Kanban style board system but you cannot view the same project in the board or list view. If you set a project at the start as a board view you're stuck with that. Also, many of the tags and filters that apply on one view do not carry over to the other. This makes everything really hard because some of the team wants to view things in list and others in a board style and you cannot do this in Asana. For our dev team, they just hate it and can't wait to get off. They can never find what they should be working on or what the priority is across multiple projects."
623,623 Asana,Asana,Colton S.,Manager/Owner,Recreational Facilities and Services,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,8,“Perfect for staying on top of team projects and to-dos ”,"Overall: Asana really has helped my small business AND my personal schedule be much more organized. It is easy to invite your employees, coworkers or family member so they can see and add tasks. It also helped cut down on having to meet with people if it's not necessary. I can make a group with a few co-workers assign tasks to each individual and a due date and we can have a dialog in the comments section all with 10 minutes or so. The due dates are probably one of the most imports parts for us as it keeps us on track with projects and simple to dues. It's also quite a but more efficient than just adding calendar events because you can check tasks off as complete and/or re-assign them as well as share them with everyone in the group. There could be a better way to display, switch and view separate Workspaces. It is slightly confusing on the user interface side after you have created more than one work space. When you create a new Workspace and want to switch back to a different one, it is not super clear on how or where to do that.",23/2/2019,Pros: Overall really nice UI that makes it easy to use for personal or business. You can add multiple people to a group or task and keep projects separate. Calendar view and being able to assign Due Dates are awesome. Additionally you can assign individual tasks to member of the project.,"Cons: There are some user interface features that are OK but could be improved mainly with adding tasks and switching from separate Workspaces. It would be nice to have custom setting for alerts when due dates are approaching, I haven't found anything to change that so far."
624,624 Asana,Asana,Joseph B.,Creative Specialist,Design,2+ years,4,3,5,,,8,“Powerful task management tool”,Overall: Asana has solved a lot of our project organization issues. Asana has a lot of potential but does require some thought for a smooth execution.,20/2/2019,"Pros: Asana does a good job at organizing tasks and delegating them to different team members. It offers different ways to organize and view projects. Along with different sorting options. You have the ability to look simply at your own tasks for all the projects, or look at everyone's task for a single project, etc. Asana has many features that you can pay to upgrade and use. Like the timeline feature, which allows tasks to be triggered when another person finishes their task. Asana really helped our company with task organization.","Cons: Setting up a project can be time-consuming, it involves knowing all the tasks in the project and who to assign them too. It takes a little bit of time to get the hang of Asana"
625,625 Asana,Asana,Renee C.,VP Marketing,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,4,4,,8,“Great collaborative tool”,"Overall: I enjoy collaborating with my design company through Asana. Since it is such an easy to use tool I never miss updates, changes or edits to designs we are currently working on.",10/2/2019,"Pros: I use Asana with my design agency and find it very easy to use. We communicate with each other on every product through the tool. Since design is very collaborative - I find Asana a great way to share ideas, updated and pretty much everything on a project by project basis. I also like that I receive emails whenever someone has done something on an open project. Since I don't ""live"" in Asana - I could easily miss updates - but with the email pings I never miss a thing.",Cons: I like using Asana very much. Although I haven't figured out how to go back to a project that I mark as done. Sometimes I would like to access something we already worke don - but once marked completed - the project disappears.
626,626 Asana,Asana,Ryan F.,I.T Officer,Banking,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana Tool - Feature and Functionality”,Overall: Better able to plan and manage projects Better able to keep on top of project updates and progress Improved collaboration and able to update work from our email clients.,9/1/2019,"Pros: As a great project management tool, this software helps our team at work collaborate easily and plan tasks and projects in real-time while keeping each team member fully updated on any progress made. The application also allows the creation of groups that can have conversations outside of the projects. It also integrates fully with our email client for response and updates to tasks which makes updateing tasks or work easier. Since using this tool, we have seen continuous improvements and added features, like the approval flag on tasks, email integration and so forth.",Cons: There isn't a feature that I do not like. We have been able to keep on top of all of our work since using this project management tool.
627,627 Asana,Asana,Kimberly H.,Project Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,"“Fantastic, Flexible Tool”",Overall: Our team has been working with in for over a month now and it is solving a lot of issues we had previously with hand-off between team members who are all working on the same project/client. We really enjoy the tools flexibility and visibility that it provides. I also used it previously at another company and it was like our Bible. Everything we did was entered in and monitored through Asana tasks.,1/1/2019,"Pros: Our team loves using Asana because it is so flexible in how it can be used. The options (even at the free level) allow you to control how you set up projects. Its such a clean slate that you can control how you want to set it up amongst your team. It gives everyone the ability to track their own tasks, but as a project manager it gives me the ability to see the bigger picture amount teams and projects.",Cons: One of its awesome features - dependencies between tasks - is only available under the premium version. I wish our team could have access to this under the free version to test it out. We will likely end up upgrading to a paid version to have access to this feature as well as the timelines tool.
628,628 Asana,Asana,Elena P.,Web Communications Coordinator,Civic & Social Organization,2+ years,4,4,4,,4,7,“Asana for ”,,2/11/2018,,"Cons: It was hard to get our team to start using it, and some people dropped off after a while, but that might be the case with any new product that requires people to track their work. We have a lot of multi-stage multi-part projects, and it can be hard sometimes to figure out the best way to create tasks and subtasks in a way that's intuitive from someone trying to look through and get a sense of the overall status of the project."
629,629 Asana,Asana,Emma K.,Project Associate,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,4,5,3,,5,8,“Great introduction to project and time management”,"Overall: Asana is a great product for what it is, but for a more robust project management experience I would look elsewhere.",26/9/2018,"Pros: The best thing about Asana is that it's free for a limited amount of users. Most project management software comes with a hefty cost that puts it out of reach for a lot of companies, Asana is different. Asana is simple to learn how to use and it doesn't take a lot of time to keep it up to date.","Cons: Since the basic level of Asana is free the functionality of the program is somewhat limited when comparing it to other project management tools. I use Asana for assigning tasks to my team and to organize and track my own workload, but for more robust project management and tracking I look to platforms."
630,630 Asana,Asana,Eileen H.,Development Director,Philanthropy,2+ years,5,5,4,,4,7,“What You Make It”,"Overall: I use it both in my personal life and business. The more time you invest in playing around with the features, the more you can personalize it to your needs.",21/9/2018,"Pros: Can be as complex or simple as you make it. On a smaller scale, it can be a good ""to-do"" task management list. On a grander scale, can be built into an entire ecosystem for an organization, in which departments personalize their projects, sections, and tasks to fit their needs. Versatility is its virtue, but can take years to realize how that fits into a company's systems.",Cons: Can be bombarded with notifications as a manager who oversees many projects. Hard to get a high-level sense of what employees have been able to accomplish when you get stuck in the weeds of micro-tasks.
631,631 Asana,Asana,Sheel C.,Dir of Operations,Cosmetics,2+ years,4,3,4,,4,8,“Full featured Project Management Software”,,15/9/2018,,"Cons: Because it's very generic, it's up to teams to either squeeze their workflow into what Asana has, or for teams to create a workflow around what Asana can do. There's not too much guidance here around ""best practices"" but it's fairly straightforward to figure out the right workflow through trial and error."
632,632 Asana,Asana,Varun K.,System Administrator,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,3,4,4,5,7,“A reliable and flexible product for collaborative task management.”,,5/8/2018,,"Cons: As the application has too many features, this can get the users confused. It takes some to get used to the system. Even though we get a lot of features if we critically examine there are less of advanced features. Another drawback is that in the case of multiple workspaces, we can't examine all of them in a go, we can only see the tasks related to a workspace and not the other."
633,633 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Photography,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“The best way to manage tasks in a team!”,,26/7/2018,,"Cons: It's actually hard to think of things we don't like about Asana! I wish they brought back their old unicorns... (if you don't know what I'm talking about, it's another reason why we LOVE Asana - they make checking tasks off your list FUN!)"

It's OS independent, and the mobile app is pretty easy to use. It has a free version and with that you can even create your own project or a personalised todo list. Another feature that I use often is create task using email, it's a pretty handy feature specially when you're already in your email client.","Cons: The free is really good that we dont think the paid/premium version is worth. There are when we wanted to have more fields on a specific task but since its quite limited we just put a lot of things on the comment section. Reporting is quite lacking and its super simple, cant really show how much the team has done over a period of time."
635,635 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,4,5,4,3,“Just nice”,"Overall: It's a great, smart to-do list, but nothing more. I prefer it for personal use. For company use with bigger teams, working with images or just wanting more than assigning and checking tasks off, you need something else.",22/7/2018,"Pros: Asana was my first team/project/workflow management application. I really liked it how simple and easy it is (with a lot of online tutorials), however it is a specific tool for managing tasks and if you expect more, you will be disappointed. Asana is just a super smart todo-list. It looks good, it is straight forward and and has some customization options as well. I highly recommend it for personal use; for team work, you might need something more complex.","Cons: I used the free version, so i cannot speak for the other versions, but most of the time you need more for a project than just a task management app. I was often frustrated when wanted to do something simple, that seemed logical Asana should do, but it just wouldn't. For example chat or image upload. So we had to get other apps for the same project and suddenly team task management was spread over 3-4 different apps. I haven't used Asana for over a year now and switched to other more complex apps. But I do recommend it if a complex to-do list is all you need."
636,636 Asana,Asana,Brent P.,Regional Marketing Manager,Primary/Secondary Education,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“The best team collaboration and project app I've used”,,2/7/2018,,"Cons: There are a couple of very minor UI things had been a problem, but I think all that I've found have been changed. These weren't bugs, just design decisions. For example, to create a new ""section"" in a project, you had to hover over ""Add Task"" which cause many a frustrated minute of searching how to add a section. However, I think the ""Add Section"" button in now permanently visible."
637,637 Asana,Asana,Eric D.,President,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,4,4,,,“Solid Project Management Tool”,,4/5/2018,,Cons: I do not like the dashboard and setup of teams versus projects. As a marketing agency we have many client teams with a variety of projects under each. The dashboard managing at the project level makes it impossible to see where we are in the a variety of projects from a variety of clients. The tool could do a much better job in reporting and dashboard level insights.

If this option exists, I do not know how it works. I love the rest."
639,639 Asana,Asana,RJ J.,Project Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“PM Tools and Tasks Made Simple”,Overall: I had been searching for a good project management tool for quite a long time when I went over Asana. The audits were awesome thus I chose to attempt it our for my group and I. Asana has satisfied its high surveys. It makes it simple to separate activities into undertakings with all around characterized rules and eadlines. The remarks include under each assignment make it simple to convey as a group. The application is additionally easy to use and I am ready to finish and turn around assignments.,21/2/2018,Pros: Asana is extraordinarily simple to set up and utilize. It is an incredible instrument for non-tech group. I would exceptionally suggest an AGILE based programming for tech groups that incorporates with Asana. Our group has thought that it was best to keep the business undertakings in Asana and the tech assignments somewhere else. Asana is exceptionally mainstream so it is normally simple to associate it to other programming. It is anything but difficult to make isolate ventures with segments and assignments and limitlessly numerous subtasks. The capacity to have subtasks and conditions makes Asana extraordinary compared to other task administration frameworks out there for me.,"Cons: I don't care for the costs of Asana, it merits saying that Asana is an extremely community oriented programming that has high-positioning capacities, however I might want it to be less expensive programming and with great openness concerning its designs and costs stipule."
640,640 Asana,Asana,Corinne F.,Executive director,Primary/Secondary Education,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“Customizable CRM or project management ”,"Overall: Asana is a great project management software usable on computer, phone or tablet. Easy to use, it is completely free for small teams to use, no need for a domain address for every user - their own e-mail address works fine.",6/2/2018,"Pros: All customizable. Almost everything is accessible for a small team, for free. Bigger teams need more resources available when you pay. Software improves with time, very fast, and almost never down. Lots of ideas on how to plan ""your asana"" are offered on the website, great tutorials too.","Cons: Because everything is Customizable, it takes time to build your own Asana view - but it's worth it. Sad there is no way of entering client data (using Asana as a CRM) unless you write information in the ""description"" box. Every client is a project/task."

It's great for managing projects (you can log in with Gmail). You can see a list view of what you need to do or a calendar view. It even has a unicorn jump across your screen randomly when you accomplish things. You can replicate projects to create templates and add attachments to tasks. I like this is not clunky like Basecamp but just does what I need it to do and periodically comes out with new features.,"Cons: I wish their mobile app was a little more robust (I hate using it) and, while I have never had an issue, I wish there was a way to back it up. That said, I figured if giant companies like Dropbox trusted them, I probably could."

But not this one!”,"Overall: Time-saving, reduced anxiety.",20/9/2017,"Pros: Still in my infancy actually utilizing Asana. I'm all about integrations: asana and I have created a machine that simplifies processes, increases efficiency, a more proactive system so that I can provide the best customer service to my clients. Calendar sync is a must, E-mailing tasks, files, adding conversations between clients, team members, thankful for the plentiful integrations and 3rd party apps - these are what change the game for asana. Tag feature comes in handy, especially when integrated w/other apps. Copy + paste from spreadsheet software is mind blowing and saves a ton of time. Overall, asana is the best project management software that's cost effective, affordable for everyone and definitely living up to the hype.","Cons: At first glance, Asana seems like the popular kid and intimidating. Over a year ago, I was initially overwhelmed, got discouraged, quit and used another app b/c of setup complications. Recently, connected w/a consultant, my life and business needed a new solution to keeping organized - asana was suggested. More variety of industry sample templates during the free trial would be helpful, at this stage i had no idea about free 3rd party templates that just make life easy. Forget everything else mentioned above: what I'm most dissatisfied about is the inability to change project layouts."

However, if you want to add others to collaborate the limit is 5 additional members (last time I checked). More than 5 you have to pay, so if you're a growing organization keep this in mind. There are other programs you can use completely free with unlimited members. I just have gotten use to Asana.",12/6/2017,"Pros: Easy on the eyes. I appreciate the check list within each task you create, the dividing titles and the fact you can create different projects to help organize and separate things. You can add comments, a description, due dates, etc, your task can be very detailed or simple.",Cons: Sometimes the site is unreachable for a short period. It scares me a little but I never lost anything. But it reminds me to export and back up everything.

You have the option to select because a vertical list of each task on each board or you can have each task separated by columns, making mico-managing much MUCH easier 2)The ""My Tasks"" tab allows for the user to see all of the tasks that they have due for every project that were assigned specifically to this user. This allows me personally to easily prioritize the remaining tasks for each day.","Cons: The free version does NOT include key features such as task dependency. As a web developer I am constantly waiting for content creators or designers to get me the resources I need to finish each project, so having task dependency allows me to keep our team in line and remind them that my work cannot be complete without their initial contribution."
645,645 Asana,Asana,Emily M.,Content Strategy Lead,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,,“A great way to manage team and personal projects/tasks. ”,,7/6/2017,,"Cons: This has less to do with the software and more to do with your team. Asana provides the ability to streamline workflow and give everyone on your team visibility, but this only truly works if your team all agrees on how to use Asana. What constitutes a 'project'? What things make sense as 'tasks'? What communications should happen in Asana vs. email vs. IRC? etc."
646,646 Asana,Asana,Yoneco E.,Owner,Management Consulting,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Great project management tool for self-employeds and freelancers.”,"Overall: Asana makes project management easy. It's my favorite for client projects that include a lot of moving pieces or extra contractors. First, I like a clean and easy to navigate dashboard, Asana has that. Set up a project and tasks, invite members to the project and assign them tasks. Simple. I can see what project areas will require multiple interactions or multiple people, and keep everyone on task. We can also message/comment to one another within each project, so there's less time on email check-ins or unnecessary team calls. And, I can track work on my own personal projects. It integrates easily, but I've only used integrations with Google calendars, Google Drive, and Dropbox. I would add that I'm self-employed, so this works well for me. If you need more comprehensive project management ' budget, resource tracking, etc. ' this probably isn't for you.",15/2/2017,"Pros: Asana makes project management easy.

The base version for personal use is free, and it just works. Highly customizable and therefore suits almost any given purpose. Unfortunately, the document preview feature is not there yet. PDF or other complex documents cannot get previewed in the browser or the apps.",25/1/2017,Pros: Asana is very versatile and useful productivity software for personal and business use. The apps for iOS are great and work well together with the web version.,"Cons: There is no option to preview PDF files or other more complex documents. In the apps, one can only upload pictures as attachments, feels like a missed opportunity."
648,648 Asana,Asana,martin t.,consultant Asana certified pro,Professional Training & Coaching,2+ years,5,5,4,,5,9,“Making my life simpler”,,10/11/2020,,Cons: There is much space to give AI a place in the software. I know the company is working on certain features. The software is so versatile it can sometime be difficult to organize your projects. That's when help comes in handy.

Assigning tasks and tracking progress is efficient and the ability to prioritize facilitates any project management team.,"Cons: I would say that Asana is not to be used as a daily task manager, but as a project management and task assignment tool. Daily tasks are not easily tracked."
651,651 Asana,Asana,Alicia d.,Account Lead,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,“Great Project Collaboration Software”,Overall:,7/10/2020,Pros: I find Asana's Kanban functionality very helpful for making progress on projects with my team. I also like how assigned items aggregate into a single tracker per team member and are organized by due date.,"Cons: When you have many projects or items on a Kanban board at once, it can be hard to have a good overall view of what the team is working on."
652,652 Asana,Asana,Kayla G.,Quality and Safety Manager,Construction,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Great Management Tool for Teams and Projects”,Overall:,4/8/2020,Pros: I found this software to be critical to the management of multiple teams deployed over multiple projects. You are able to see and track each project in it's own view and see the status of each team members tasks.,Cons: A lot of the features you do need to pay for and the price can be high if you have large teams. The software can still be used for free and is functionable for team and task management without paying however.
653,653 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Banking,2+ years,4,4,4,3,4,8,“Good for project collaboration”,Overall: Asana is mostly free so this allows us to test it's capabilities and it serves us well.

I like the feature to create deadline on tasks for team members,Cons:  Asana is a good project management tool but is not the best I've used for collaboration with team members especially in the area of visualisation.

It has helped guide our team meetings and create action items, give updates on projects to co-workers, really good tool",4/4/2020,"Pros: You can keep organized for projects and/or personal tasks that you need to complete. You can tag other teammates, create project boards and to do lists easily, etc.",Cons: It is easy to use. No real complaints at this time. It does require you to refresh often for updates.
656,656 Asana,Asana,Bianca H.,Program Manager,Education Management,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,10,“Simple project management platform”,"Overall: The most interesting thing, Asana has a Gantt chart view for our projects. It also has timeline that keeps us active with all activities. It has been an excellent invention all around the world because it is benefiting us in many ways. It is a high quality task and project management platform. I like the customization features of Asana. I strongly recommend it to others for their projects.",29/3/2020,Pros: It helps us in improving team collaboration and communication sector. It is the tool we can use for handling many tasks. We can conveniently create projects and assign work to teammates. Asana is a wonderful platform for the management of tasks and projects. It has many basic features and capabilities as a CRM. It is a cloud based product. I also like the way it can be integrated with other applications. It has given us a great platform for communication purposes. Moreover we can track all activities and manage all interactions.,Cons: As I have been using Asana for many years it is providing fantastic services. I really love its features and functionalities. It is an awesome place for managing all tasks. It helps us giving power to our projects.
657,657 Asana,Asana,Christopher R.,Application Analyst,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,4,5,5,,,8,“So many features... how to use them all?”,Overall: I like having Asana as an additional tracking platform for projects; there's only so much you can fit into your digital calendar and having a dedicated location for project specifics is really appreciated. (even if all the features are a bit daunting),20/2/2020,"Pros: Asana has a clean, intuitive interface that makes it very simple to track progress on numerous projects, assigned to a variety of groups with fluctuating members. I also enjoyed the ease with which I could update and monitor my individual tasks while also maintaining responses from the group members or specific individuals.",Cons: Feature overload! There's so much! Not sure if this is something to address with our administrator but I definitely feel overwhelmed as an end-user by all my options. This may be a benefit for your purposes and may be a short coming of our specific configuration; just something to keep in mind.
658,658 Asana,Asana,Martin B.,Customer Success manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“Asana works for Free (almost!)”,Overall: Daily tasks and Project management are the primary use cases for ASANA at our company.,12/2/2020,"Pros: For a SAAS product, it is extremely fast! Personalization is a breeze. cost is very reasonable. It helps our Teams to communicate.",Cons: It would be nice to integrate ASANA with our CRM. The ASANA CRM functionality is not as good as some of the other CRM offerings
659,659 Asana,Asana,Nikki K.,Assistant Director of Brand Management,Higher Education,2+ years,4,4,5,,,8,“Project Management to the Nth Degree”,"Overall: The program is so helpful in project management and automation. It's helping us track projects much better than we had in the past. The only downfall is that not all team members use it to its full functionality. If they did though, it'd be a major game-changer. That being said, automation can never take the place of a good old fashioned meeting or in-person discussion so they must coexist.",8/1/2020,"Pros: I really like the organization of this software. You can use it in so many ways, it seems like it could be tailored for any organization and it's specific needs. There are so many ways to automate and customize","Cons: There is almost too much you can do! It can easily become a time suck to keep up with and can get overwhelming. We struggled when we first started using the program to find the best way to track our projects. Almost 2 years later, we've gotten a better system down but the transition wasn't easy."
660,660 Asana,Asana,Megan K.,Marketing & Business Development Coordinator,Accounting,2+ years,5,5,4,,4,8,“Asana is a great task and project tracking software for our team! ”,Overall:,7/1/2020,Pros: I like the ease of the software and the app capabilities. Asana does a great job of making it easy to use no matter who on our team is trying to utilize it. I also like the visual representation of the lists and the timeline features. Visualizing deadlines helps our team to better understand and keep track. I also really like the commenting feature so that our team members can give updates on the status of the project.,Cons: Sometimes the tasks aren't able to include all of the features I Would want to include in a task. Since we got the paid version there is a lot more functionality.

My team works together on most projects, so we need something that makes the process seamless. And Asana does just that. I'm thankful for the smooth, customer-friendly UX on the backend as well. It also integrates with Slack","Cons: The only con would be the price. I feel for a small business like us, it's a bit costly."
662,662 Asana,Asana,Marianne M.,Office Administrator,Real Estate,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Fantastic Project Management Software!”,Overall: So far its great and we will continue to use and experiment with the program.,13/12/2019,"Pros: Ease of group communication, ability to create and delegate tasks and sub-tasks, increases productivity, and simple design and interface.",Cons: A group chat function would be helpful that is not considered and add-on. Sub-tasks are not as easy to view as the task are but still functional.
663,663 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Best Project Management Tool for Non Dev Teams”,Overall: Easy to use project management tool to keep track of tasks and improve collaboration within the company,3/12/2019,Pros: Amazing User Interface & User Experience Easy to Use Freemium version has a lot of features Asana > Basecamp & Monday Also covers trello(boards) part of the app.,Cons: Not that I could think of. It's absolutely great tool. It would be injustice to list cons just for the sake of it.
664,664 Asana,Asana,Cheryl N.,Content Curator,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,5,3,5,4,7,“More features to improve”,Overall:,28/11/2019,"Pros: It is an all-in-one platform that is beneficial for teams. I love it because aside from being a great app to manage multiple projects in one place, it also allows me to communicate with other team members regarding the project that we are working on using the comment + inbox section. It has a clean interface, allowing me to see the tasks that are due for the day. It makes me focus on what to prioritize first.","Cons: I hate the subtasks keep popping up even when I already marked them complete. Because of that, it appears that I have past due even when I have already finished doing those subtasks. Also, I set up desktop notifications but sometimes it doesn't remind me whenever an action is made to the task that I am following."
665,665 Asana,Asana,David H.,Head of development,E-Learning,2+ years,5,5,5,,4,9,“Excellent project management tool”,Overall: It helps us manage a wide variety of projects and manage a diverse team in multiple locations.,6/11/2019,"Pros: It's very easy to setup projects, task lists, allocate tasks to team members, collaborate, share assets, discuss progress. It helps us priorise and stay on focus.","Cons: In regards to cost, it's quite a big jump from a free 15 user subscription to a paid-for version as soon as you need 16 users. It would be good to have different tiers of subscription (active/heavy user vs. users that just need to have view access to monitor progress or log into the system maybe once a month)."
666,666 Asana,Asana,Kory P.,Junior Associate,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,4,4,5,,5,8,“Great Project Management Tool”,"Overall: Asana has truly helped our project management. We have a shared space with our clients, which is vital in consulting. It truly helps keep our team(s) on track and manage deadlines and capacity. The updates have been great and it helps us analyze and plan projects and how long they will take.",29/10/2019,"Pros: Asana is a great project management tool for teams of all sizes. The free version is terrific for small teams who need a place to manage tasks, projects, and shared files. The paid version is great to manage all aspects of small-medium size businesses, from hiring to client management to IT to product implementation. Asana also works relatively well with other apps.","Cons: I wish I could download or copy the timeline for reports or presentations. There could also be more templates, which there seems to be more of now. I think the integrations, primarily with gmail, could be improved."
667,667 Asana,Asana,Miguel G.,Senior Programmer,Entertainment,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,9,“Agile system”,"Overall: We started used Asana for managing our team, a while ago we used things like trello, but Asana was in another level. Managing the time and the tasks on our board is even more easy with this software.",22/10/2019,"Pros: Asana is an easy to use tool that will let you manage your time and the time of your co-workers in an effective way. If you are an Agile user, this tool might be for you.","Cons: The software is really good at what it does, probably I will just add a little customization at some parts, but nothing too serious."
668,668 Asana,Asana,Maider I.,Marketing Consultant,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,3,5,,,8,“Excellent tool for project management”,"Overall: It's been a good experience thus far. The first couple of weeks I had to get acquainted with using Asana and transitioning from using different tools in the past, but I like that it keeps everything in the dashboard and I can easily see what tasks have been assigned to me, what their parent tasks are to get a better scope of the project and when deadlines are.",17/9/2019,"Pros: One of my clients uses Asana to manage all their projects. In my particular case, I'm responsible for delivering marketing content for them and using Asana makes things a lot easier to remember deadlines, know what projects I'm working on and share the content with the rest of the team. I like how practical it is.","Cons: It took me a little bit of time to get the hang of it, mainly because prior to that I'd been using Trello for years and the platforms are different. Once you get to know how it works however, it offers way more features than Trello."
669,669 Asana,Asana,Amy A.,Coordinator,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,5,5,5,,,8,“Meeting Collaboration ”,Overall: It's been great for my needs and I've been using it for almost 2 years.,17/9/2019,"Pros: My team and I use this software for meetings. We all input what we'd like to discuss before our meetings and it's been a great collaboration tool. It's a great way to set priorities as well as an agenda. I'm not as familiar with this tool for project tracking because I use it for the very basics, but for my needs and reminders, it's been really good.","Cons: Too many emails as reminders. Not sure if you can find another way for reminders, but I don't mind it, until it gets overwhelmingly a lot."
670,670 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“I love asana!”,Overall: I would be lost without it,28/8/2019,Pros: It helps me keep track of my team and I's tasks on a daily basis.,Cons: I wish it would automatically sort by due date
671,671 Asana,Asana,Ina Eliza G.,Administrator,Insurance,2+ years,5,4,4,,,9,“A great software to use for working with a team”,"Overall: I am using Asana to work on projects regarding both work and my side business. Until now we were only small teams(Max 3 people). We succeeded to structure our work, to get an overview on what we have and to make a plan on how to act. Each of us was getting reminders on the tasks that were delegated for each of us. We could add the results that we were having and also the aditional info that we needed to move forward. We really loved having everything in one place and being able to keep a track on how things were moving (especially that the team members were from different countries). Really recommend it.",23/8/2019,"Pros: I like the options that it gives you: you can write, you can add pictures, you can use different colors for different projects, you can archive old projects, you can make as many maps as you need and you can put deadlines, assign tasks for a certain team member. You can access, easily the info that you need. And all these is offered by the free version. If you want more, you need to upgrade. But if you are just starting, the free version is enough.","Cons: Sometimes you get lost in all the maps and tasks and you could forget where exactly you wrote something or in what chat you discussed something. But I guess, if you are more organised or have a system, this can be avoided."
672,672 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Research,2+ years,4,5,4,,3,7,"“Fast, user friendly, task manager ...for large companies”",,22/8/2019,,"Cons: - Great extra features (such as custom fields, timeline, forms, medium-sized teams...) are quite expensive for small or medium teams or non-profits. It seems to be addressed to large companies only - Lacks integration with other time tracking services other than their own (and expensive) harvest, such as toggl or clockify - Lacks a GTD approach - Integration with other apps/services - Lacks data export (platform lock-in)"
673,673 Asana,Asana,Jennifer C.,Executive Recruiter,Mechanical or Industrial Engineering,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Project Management Gold!”,,15/8/2019,,"Cons: As far as I know, tasks cannot be given priority which would be very useful. They dont need to generate an email from Asana as a notification of a task being completed/added, etc. Its redundant."
674,674 Asana,Asana,James D.,Head Of Design,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Great team organisation”,,12/8/2019,,Cons: It can get a bit complicated when you have a lot of projects on the go and some of the filtering/organisation could be slicker. But nothing major to report on from my standpoint.
675,675 Asana,Asana,Divan v.,Graphic Designer,Design,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“On top of it”,,2/8/2019,,Cons: Not many people use it or know about it so building a team of clients that can approve and converse on all of your projects will take some time.
676,676 Asana,Asana,Stefon J.,Unix System Administrator,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana is a productive tool with efficient team collaboration features.”,"Overall: Asana has simplified our teamwork and allow us to produce more efficient results and team collaborations. We can easily access the other people work and can stay updated on a on-going project, It has improved our working efficiency in lots of ways.",31/7/2019,"Pros: Asana is a proven tool for high end collaborations on projects and tasks at workplace. It allows us to use all the working platforms like sheets, docs , mails and communication at one place. We can easily elevate our working routine and productive efficiency with the help of this amazing collaboration tool.",Cons: Although it has been an amazing tool for collaboration but it's quite difficult to use and there's lot that users should be aware of before starting working with Asana. The user-interface is also quite complex. We also can't even customize this tool for our required procedures else we have to adjust according to it.
677,677 Asana,Asana,sharena w.,Director of Marketing Communications,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,"“Free, Reliable, Convenient”",,25/7/2019,,"Cons: No much I can say here. Perhaps an additional feature that would be useful, would be the ability to set push notification reminders for certain tasks."
678,678 Asana,Asana,Robin S.,COO,Arts and Crafts,2+ years,5,4,4,3,4,7,“Improving productivity”,Overall: Improved cross team Productivity for remote team,24/7/2019,Pros: Ready made templates makes setting up projects for a variety of functions very easy. On top of that the instructions included in each template reduce startup time.,Cons: I wish that I could adjust aspects of my projects through the use of commands and key strokes when sending an email to the project email as opposed to just having things listed as comments.
679,679 Asana,Asana,Lucas D.,Creative Services Manager,Entertainment,2+ years,4,5,5,3,3,10,“Asana”,Overall:,18/7/2019,"Pros: I manage a lot of projects at the same time and I love that this platform is so visual and intuitive. It helps me organize, I love that it sends me alerts everyday for projects that are due, follow-up on other endeavors that have been stagnant. It helps me communicate and tag my team members and distribute their tasks very efficiently.","Cons: It crashes some times and it kicks me out of my account at least 3 times a week, which can be very annoying and frustrating."
680,680 Asana,Asana,Laura G.,"Photographer, Owner",Photography,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Transformed My Business”,"Overall: Before I found Asana I didn't know where to start, what I was working on, what I had finished and was due and my life and business was pretty much chaos. All my attempts at some spreadsheets with some sort of organization had miserably failed. The moment my Virtual Assistant introduced me to Asana was the moment everything changed and I started taking control of my TIME, which is THE one precious asset we all have and is non-renewable. I could not imagine going back to times when Asana is not in my life keeping me organized.",20/3/2019,"Pros: I love the option to choose between List or Kanban style boards. I love that you can assign various team members to various tasks, view things in calendar mode, communicate via chat about every task, attach documents and images, insert links in chats. You can use various integrations with various apps like Google Drive, Slack, whatever you can think of that you use, you can make zaps via Zapier and create lots of great automations, Asana can be a really powerful tool if you get to know it well.","Cons: The one things I do not like is the fact that if you start with a project in List mode, you will not be able to switch to Board mode afterwards. So be very careful of what your visual style is and plan accordingly before making your project."
681,681 Asana,Asana,Joshua P.,Vice President of Technology Strategy,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“I could not function without Asana”,"Overall: We use Asana to manage not only projects, but ongoing account management and various types of activities both internal and external. Total game changer for us.",12/3/2019,"Pros: I love the overall attention to user experience (UX) and ease of use. I am a technology person so it's easy for me to learn tools, but I work with hundreds of people who are NOT tech people and being able to quickly show them how to interact with Asana makes project and stakeholder management so much easier I can't even quantify it.","Cons: Lack of attention to security. I work on some sensitive projects where I can't use Asana because of limitations in security (like restricting access to Teams, Projects and Tasks within a Workspace)."
682,682 Asana,Asana,Tyler S.,Owner / Creative Director,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana is the app for that!”,Overall: We have a team of 12 and around 5 guests working in asana on projects for 15 or so clients... around 25 projects per client. Asana makes sense of all of that for us and the thousands of tasks doable.,28/2/2019,"Pros: Asana continues to keep things consistent while moving the product forward. That is important so that our staff doesn't have to learn a new platform with each big update. Instead, there are new capabilities built into the same Asana we've known for a few years. Having come from Basecamp, Asana has given us more horsepower in how we manage projects.","Cons: You have to make it what you want, so a lot of people aren't sure how to start out. But once you wrap your head around how you want your projects to work, it's easy."

As a husband, it has helped immensely to organize the life of my wife and I. It's really the best way I've been able to ever organize my thoughts- paper is good, and a calendar is pretty good, standing alone, however, Asana brings them all together.",16/2/2019,"Pros: Asana is a great organizational tool, but not only that, it will bring a small team together, unifying the platforms, goals, tasks at hand, and tools you use in one place.","Cons: The software has a few cons, but not enough to give it a bad rap. I wish it was easier to customize without purchasing the business version. Free for small teams - up to 15, should have a few mote features baked in."
684,684 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Comprehensive task management for teams of any size”,Overall: We migrated to Asana from EasyProjects and BaseCamp. Asana is much more complex so it was intimidating at first but now our team can't imagine using anything else. Most of us use it to manage our personal lives as well,15/2/2019,Pros: Notifications and reminders can stay within the application so that your email inbox doesn't get overloaded. Their app is amazing so you can update tasks when you are not near a computer. They have templates for projects that you routinely create. Different skins allow you to customize the look of the desktop app.,Cons: It was a little difficult to transition to Asana from a simpler task management app since there are so many aspects but customer support was awesome in setting everything up.
685,685 Asana,Asana,Robert S.,Senior Corporate Account Manager,Retail,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,9,“Asana provides efficient team management and project coordination. ”,,15/1/2019,,"Cons: Asana is quite helpful with simpler user-interface. Few problems occurs in chatting session , where it is rather difficult to find out specific comments and messages. We also faces issues in tracking certain aspects of project. It is rather quite suitable for only smaller level organization where less coordination is required."
686,686 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Public Relations and Communications,2+ years,5,3,5,,,10,“Advanced Project Management for Individuals or Teams”,,15/1/2019,,"Cons: What makes Asana so advanced also makes it difficult to learn for users who have never experimented with different project management tools before. There is a 30-minute tutorial video for new users that I highly recommend people watch. 30 minutes might seem like a long investment out of a busy day, but it will save more time than that as you learn to use the platform."
687,687 Asana,Asana,Victoria D.,Data & Administrative Coordinator,Executive Office,2+ years,5,4,4,,4,10,“Great for Productivity Flow”,Overall:,8/1/2019,"Pros: Ease of use. It's as easy as pressing the Enter button to create a new task. Great functionality to assign date, team member assignee and transfer to others just as easily. I use the tagging ability often to keep all my projects straight and I find the calendar feature for each project useful to keep me on track.","Cons: You're not able to assign a task to more than one person. For teams, like mine, it would be great to assign to multiple team members so that it will appear in each person's ""My Task"" list. I find that I use the My Task list the most and it would be helpful to see ALL tasks including those I'm following that I'm mutually working on with other team members."
688,688 Asana,Asana,Deepak R.,PHP Developer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Good tool to manage your prjects”,Overall: The overall experience with asana is very good. Used can easily manage and keep track of their projects by using asanas by adding the project into asana. They can keep track of each and every module of a particular project by adding it on asanas software. This is an excellent to to handle the projects in a well manner.,28/12/2018,Pros: In Asana the best feature is to list the project tasks as individual card. User can easily identified and task on Asana. Also used can update the status of each card that the particular task is done or not.,Cons: The thing I don't like about asana is a long list of tasks it's not easy to handle a long list of all the modules or tasks. There should be an easy way to categorise the task into a single category.
689,689 Asana,Asana,Brittany M.,Director of Corporate Communications,Mental Health Care,2+ years,5,5,4,,,10,“Great Content Management Tool”,"Overall: We've been using Asana for almost two years for content management and absolutely love its functionality. While there are some minor limitations, Asana has proven to be an effective tool in helping our team to visualize, plan, and execute our marketing strategies.",12/12/2018,"Pros: Our department uses Asana as a content management tool for our social media calendar. The color-coding options and task assignment options (including subtasks) help us to stay on track and ensure that our content is produced, managed and posted properly.","Cons: While just a small detail, reoccurring tasks are not easily duplicated. The task must be marked complete before it duplicates - which makes the overall visualization of the month ahead incomplete."
690,690 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,4,5,4,7,“Asana is a great task reminder ”,Overall: Asana is great to plan every step of your project and track who's doing each tasks. I find it useful also for tracking bugs and to track features request from people not so technical to do that directly in Github or Jira.,26/11/2018,Pros: After last redesign Asana improves a lot his easiness of use. It seems more professional and more stable. The feature that i like the most is the ability to assign subtask to a specific task so i can granulate and divide every step to the minimum effort block.,Cons: It takes a lot to learn how use every feature. There are so much and it requires someone who have already knowledge on that to guide other team members. It lacks a more quick communication channel than mentioning and email
691,691 Asana,Asana,Erica W.,Project Manager,Construction,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Powerful and effective tool particularly designed for project managements.”,"Overall: If I talk about my overall experience, I would say with Asana we can communicate with our team members easily and quickly. It is no doubt considered to be the superb replacement of task management. It is no doubt most effective, powerful and user friendly software.",8/11/2018,Pros: Asana is really easy to use. One can learn it's functionalities within shorter time. It provides easy ways of tracing projects as well as tasks. It has emerged excellent solutions for managing projects. It is the best software that facilitates users with immediate collaboration. Another advantage is that we need not sort out things or files because Asana keeps all things well organized. Amazing solution to our problems. It is fully featured that fulfills all the requirements of business.,"Cons: Asana is the nicely developed application I use. It is a bit difficult to find any kind of least thing that I have ever realize. It is all about satisfaction of its being a high quality product. One thing that can be a suggestion for others that I was facing in previous days, Asana is is a little heavy application and there must be a strong internet connection for a better response. If there is weak connection, I have to face delays in my work and most of my time get wasted. Anyhow, it works fantastically."
692,692 Asana,Asana,Cory P.,Project Coordinator,Research,2+ years,5,4,5,,,8,“Project Management Made Simple”,,9/10/2018,,"Cons: There was a little bit of a learning curve in the beginning. Managers were having difficulty creating and properly assigning tasks, and team members were having difficulty finding the tasks on the Asana platform. This has less to do with the platform, and more to do with user error. But after a week or so, the entire team was on board and running smoothly with the program. Definitely account for some turbulence in the beginning of implementing this program, and make use of Asana's online resources to help learn how to properly use the tool."
693,693 Asana,Asana,Katherine B.,Facilities Analyst,Facilities Services,2+ years,4,4,5,,5,8,“Asasa great free web-based project management software”,Overall: Another group I was working with introduced me to the application and it was really great. I can see how this can be used at many different organizations. I especially loved it because my workforce was so mobile and we didn't always see each other - so it was easy to make sure people are getting tasks and understanding when they got done.,19/9/2018,"Pros: So easy to keep track of tasks, assign tasks to people, as well as create projects. What was the best for me and my team is that you can use it with a mobile which was perfect because many people were out in the field and not at a computer. I would personally use it again in my new job if it ever became a need - its similar and a cheaper version of many CMMS systems out there.",Cons: I wish that you would get a notification for new tasks and you can just check it on the app. Asana sent ALOT of emails and sometimes it was too much to see the thread.
694,694 Asana,Asana,Liz W.,Founder & Co-CEO,Food Production,2+ years,5,5,4,,5,10,“Easy to use powerful task & project management in an attractive interface”,,11/7/2018,,"Cons: The file storage is very messy. You end up with long rows of unorganized files. Also, when integrating Asana with other programs through the use of a 3rd party connector, the number of workspaces you have to scroll through to get the right one can be tedious."
695,695 Asana,Asana,meagan e.,Programs & Policy Sr. Associate,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,4,4,3,5,10,"“As a lover of productivity hacks and organizationl tools, Asana is the way to work. ”",Overall: Improve my daily life and work,18/1/2018,"Pros: - great design - the free version has a lot of fuctionality - LOVE that you can email tasks to yourself or others. These task are automatically added to your to-do list - option between to-do lists and boards - easy to communicate with other staff members - great snapshot/overview of project's progress - at the premium level, you can create and recycle templates -asana easily communicates with several other platforms","Cons: - would appreciate more layout features specifically gnatt charts (although instagnatt attempts to fit this niche) - would love a ""chat"" feature that is not recorded - my colleagues and I gravitated to using this workflow system and has made our collaboration so much more efficient. However management has not fully adopted Asana which makes this productivity tool not as productive. I know this is a ""me"" problem, but I would advise future Asana users to make sure that all staff is on board with special attention to tech-resistant folks."
696,696 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,4,5,5,4,5,9,"“Free Version, Great for Individuals and Teams!”","Overall: I can quickly move through emails, and assign each a specific task if it needs follow up. Then I can prioritize and get to work. I work remotely, so this helps me to track all of my work, and to sort it by project, and to tangibly see all my deadlines so I don't let something fall through the cracks.",13/10/2017,Pros: I love being able to take emails and sum them up in specific tasks in Asana. I can then prioritize my daily tasks and longer term projects. Working with interns was a breeze being able to assign them tasks and track their progress without getting lost in a sea of emails.,"Cons: I have been a user for a long time, and was waiting for greater mobile platforms. There have recently been updates, specifically for iPad, and my concerns were rectified. I love it."
697,697 Asana,Asana,Rinat N.,Co-founder,Human Resources,2+ years,4,4,4,3,4,8,“Very good software project management tool with wide functionality and integration”,Overall: Managing organizational projects.,19/9/2017,"Pros: Been using the app for the very long time. I like the ability to tag tasks. The software looks better recently, as it has some visual improvements. Finally, the heart for like was replaced for a normal icon of a thumb up.","Cons: It has a lot of different functionality and sometimes seems too heavy, cluttered and hard to get around. When you open and have a lot of tasks on you it's hard to concentrate and focus on a single task. I don't like that you cannot create subfolders within a project and have to use semicolons to separate things or milestones. I don't like that it shows the text with the history of the tasks activity. It's makes it hard to read and very busy."
698,698 Asana,Asana,Abbas H.,Managing Director,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,10,“A case study in making collaboration easy and overcoming the challenge of being organized!”,"Overall: Helps me keep organized without getting distracted or overwhelmed by too many things on my screen. It has a LOT of features, but you only use what works for you.",19/9/2017,"Pros: - Love how simple it is to start for new users - Since the last update, it has become even faster to use - Excellent mobile app - You can make a process as simple (long one page task list with sections for personal use), or as complex (team projects, with milestones, with calendar, with sharing and security, with Kanban boards, templates etc.) as you want. - Best help section i've seen on any app",Cons: - Used to dislike the extra second or two it took to close tasks and refresh (but this was resolved with recent update. It's now super snappy)
699,699 Asana,Asana,Alex T.,Owner,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,5,5,3,10,“Excellent Project Management Tool”,"Overall: I've been using Asana for well over a year now, and honestly, not sure how I would ever do without it. It can organize your project into a task list like structure, or if you're more Agile inclined, then you can have it display your tasks as a board. Each task supports file uploads, and a threaded discussion, so it's easy to keep track of everything task related in one single place. You can easily invite others to participate in the project. This includes team members, as well as stakeholders. In my particular experience, it was easier for me to let a stakeholder add tasks to an existing on-going project. They were able to quickly and easily pick this up and go with it. My one complaint is that in order to take full advantage of all of the features, you have to buy a 5 user license. I happen to work alone, and stakeholder access is free, so I end up with spending a bit more than I like. Other than that, this is a solid product that's easy to use, and is well worth using",12/4/2017,"Pros: Easy to use, keep all related tasks and task artifacts together in one place.","Cons: Not the best mobile app. Must purchase a 5 user license to use all features, even if you work alone."
700,700 Asana,Asana,Danielle A.,Marketing Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,4,4,5,10,“Best project management tool I've used.”,Overall: I really like the ease of use with Asana and organizational features. I've used several platforms for project management and this one is the only one that really speaks my language.,6/12/2016,Pros: Ability to create subtasks and smaller projects within a bigger project. I also like the drag and drop feature for re-ordering tasks after they are created.,"Cons: The only thing that stands out right now is how you have to scroll to the top to click the add a task button. Sometimes, I'll be further down the page for a project in a section and want to add a task there while looking at the other tasks in that section, but you have to scroll to the top. If there was an add task button that could be added as new sections are added, that would be perfect!"
701,701 Asana,Asana,Casey G.,Sr. Graphic Designer,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,4,4,9,“I wish all my jobs used this!”,"Overall: This has been a life saver. As a designer with requests from several different departments and clients, this not only helps me keep track of what needs to be done... but it also allows everyone else to see why/when I'm busy. It helps me be more transparent and realistic when it comes to timelines, saves me from having to answer countless questions about what I'm working on and when, and seems to make everything run a bit smoother. I definitely recommend",10/11/2016,"Pros: I like how easy it is to use. I like that it's collaborative and that we all can share and create lists. I love the drag and drop features, like when you what to move an event- it is probably my favorite feature because it's so intuitive.",Cons: I don't like having to login. Like it seems to only work when I'm using a specific google profile. Could you develop a desktop app so I could leave it open all the time and get notifications? I'd love that.
702,702 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Translation and Localization,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,8,“Game changer for you project management”,Overall: I really like how easy to use and powerful the tool is. You can also enable notifications and other integrations so that you are always on top of everything and don't miss any deadline.,12/9/2020,"Pros: Having used only email on previous companies for people to send requests our way, having a tool like Asana was a total revelation and a game-changer when it comes to assigning projects and work collaboratively with a team.","Cons: They are starting to develop new features that are only available if you commit to a pricier tier with them. Of course, I understand they need to make profit out of the tool but sometimes small to medium companies can't afford to go all in and therefore can't benefit from all features."
703,703 Asana,Asana,Amber H.,Administrative Project Manager,Health,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana Magic”,"Overall: The learning resources available to everyone through the Asana Guide are amazing. I've gone through the Asana Ambassador training program, which has been so helpful for learning tools & tricks. I love being able to draw information & advice from the Community Forum. I also think it's awesome that the Asana team receives feedback on all of the new feature rollouts and is consistently making updates & adjustments for improvement.",16/7/2020,Pros: I love using Asana to manage projects. Custom fields are so useful to being able to track everything we need to be able to see. I am so excited to start using Portfolios to track workload and Goals to track our quarterly objectives. I can't wait to see what's next,"Cons: The thing I like least about Asana is the ""Close details"" button for a subtask doesn't bring you back to the parent task, it closes that right side box completely and brings you back to the project."
704,704 Asana,Asana,Tom S.,Director of Customer Success,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Productivity for people that work together”,Overall: Asana is the best software I have ever used. For anything. Ever. The organization and people behind it are also wonderful and inspiring.,7/7/2020,"Pros: The user experience and interface makes me want to use it, it's available wherever I am on multiple devices. It actually feeds my productivity to achieve so many things, rather than becoming an end in itself. The combination of Asana, Slack and Google Apps really does kill the internal email thread. (The email thread has become the most disgustingly wasteful organization tool that software ever invented!)","Cons: The mobile app used to be underwhelming a few years ago. It is much improved, but I still want more from it."
705,705 Asana,Asana,Francesca P.,Founder of the Empower & Flow Method,E-Learning,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“The best task and project management tool”,"Overall: I have been using it for 5+ years starting from when I was a student, I have tried many other tools and softwares and I can confidently say it's the best on the market.",26/6/2020,"Pros: I love how versatile and simple Asana is. It has a beautifully-to-use and interface to plan, organize and manage tasks and projects. I love that it's very visual and that you can easily see the progress of your different projects, it integrates with the G-suite and so many other applications, plus you can get an automated to-do list for every single day and then simply think about execution.",Cons: The mobile app can be improved and made easier to use. For now it's not at the same level.
706,706 Asana,Asana,Al R.,Co Founder,Media Production,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Solid Platform for Teams”,Overall:,19/6/2020,"Pros: The platform makes it easy to organize what our team objectives are, the tasks needed to accomplish the objectives, who is responsible for those tasks, and when they are expected to be completed. This system of organization allows our projects to run quite smoothly so long as everyone understands how to use the platform.",Cons: Unfortunately you get billed for 5 users right out of the gate instead of being billed per user so if only a few of your team members need premium level features you'll have to pay the full amount for 5 seats.
707,707 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Mining & Metals,2+ years,3,4,3,3,4,7,“Easy to use and quite straightforward”,"Overall: The first thing I find it very useful is that it helps a lot to manage my time and set priorities for different tasks. Because of its ability to be in different projects features, it will be quite handy for the ones who involve in different teams of a company like HR, Project Management.",13/4/2020,"Pros: It's quite easy to use and it has helped me a lot to keep track of my daily tasks. I find it very satisfying to complete the tasks right after i finish them. It is also handy for the management team to review everyone's tasks and how they're doing at the end of the day. It has already got essential features for task management even in free version, but I'd love to go premium later.",Cons: I hope it could provide more features like insights and trends in free version. But it is still okay to see the general insights of your work.
708,708 Asana,Asana,Aaron James S.,Operations Specialist,Real Estate,2+ years,4,5,4,4,4,8,“Decent Project Management solution”,"Overall: It works for the most part, except that as a team, when handling projects, we don't have a clear visibility on the completion of each project except when looking at the tasks that are still left undone. No percentage completion per se, it seems.",7/4/2020,"Pros: You can easily set up tasks and indicate deadlines. Recurring tasks can be easily done and integrated into the software unlike, say, in Basecamp. Projects and Templates can be created inside the app.","Cons: The list of tasks and to-dos can tend to be a huge clutter, and it does not feel like you can clearly see the progression within a project. If you use an email solution like Front, and you have it set to create a contact for each new email address that sends a message, you'd get a ton of spammy email addresses since notifications from Asana come from what seems to be an auto generated email address."
709,709 Asana,Asana,Julie B.,Marketing Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,4,,,8,“Best I've tried so far”,Overall: We use this daily to keep track of my to-do lists and organize which tasks are most important. It has also been great when we need to share progress and assets with multiple stakeholders. Helps keep thing organized in the project when it would get quickly lost in email exchanges.,7/2/2020,"Pros: Great for keeping track of task list, sharing details about project progress with multiple stakeholders. helps me stay organized","Cons: I struggle to keep track of multiple projects that are all in different ""teams"" There may be an easy way to keep track of these that is not obvious to me."

Asana helps me complete projects in an orderly and timely fashion.,6/2/2020,"Pros: Asana makes it easy to keep everything organized. You can create a Team for you and your coworkers and then any number of projects under that. Each project can have it's own task list and each task can have a subtask list. Possibilities are endless when setting up anything you need to do. Additionally, you can integrate Asana with your Gmail calendar, it will send you reminders (daily) with a list of everything due, you can assign tasks, add URLs, links to images, etc.","Cons: Some of the more advanced features are part of the Premium version, however, Asana functions VERY well with the free version."
711,711 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Entertainment,2+ years,4,5,4,,,8,“Super Easy and Intuitive Task Management Tool”,"Overall: Asana has really aided our work team's communication and efficiency. It has been easy for everyone to pick up and start using and has rarely, if ever, caused us any problems or headaches. I'd highly recommend it as a task management tool for any business.",10/12/2019,"Pros: My favorite aspect of Asana, by far, is how easy it is to customize task lists for everyone on your team. This greatly helps with organizing and keeping everyone focused on whatever specific task they need to be focused on, and leaves very little room for confusion or dropped items. I also like how Asana tracks achievements and allows every person on my team to see what everyone has achieved and the progress we have all made - it has led to a great communal feeling of success. The entire program is easy to pick up and understand and has made our work life dramatically easier.","Cons: I'd love it if Asana could implement a chat feature to be able to communicate among team members. We use Slack to communicate as a team, so it wouldn't have to be really elaborate. But when I see a new task pop up and have a question, it would be nice to be able to ask it right there in the program, rather than having to turn and use something else."
712,712 Asana,Asana,Juan Jose O.,Team Lead,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“It's a smooth tool to track your work”,"Overall: I decided to implement asana in the project I managed since I heard good feedback about it, I did not dissapoint to me, I feel confortable using it.",5/12/2019,"Pros: The UI is very nice, it's friendly with you, it's easy to understand every feature they offer to you.","Cons: They added new cool features but we need to pay, that's why we stopped working with it. Other than that it's okay"
713,713 Asana,Asana,Christopher F.,Marketing Communications Specialist,Building Materials,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana - Perfect for any team to manage a project”,"Overall: It is a program that continues to elevate my career as I am tasked with more projects and responsibilities to maintain. I've even introduced the software to many of the vendors I closely work with, to get them involved as well.",5/12/2019,"Pros: Asana does a great job of customizing how you want to organize your work. The myriad of options and the well thought out UI really make Asana the best of the pack of PM software solutions. We have our entire marketing department using it now, and keeping track of a multitude of high-profile projects has never been easier.",Cons: Very minor grip - I wish it had more options to customize colors. Trello has quite a few different options for this whereas Asana is a bit more locked.

I loved everything about it. Because of their new updates I am actively searching for new software. Even with the decline in functionality, I still haven't found something to replace it.

It (was) simple, fast, intuitive","Cons: Their recent updates have been more negative than positive. They've removed functionality from their mobile app, made it more complicated to categorize and delete categories, removed keyboard shortcuts. They took something that was working well and made it more clunky."
715,715 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Legal Services,2+ years,4,4,4,3,4,9,“Project planning at its best”,"Overall: In our company 50% of people work remotely and in different time zones. Messaging app are most of the time not allowing us to remember what to do and when. Asana solved the problem of remembering stuff, scheduling tasks and planning for weeks (and months) ahead. I'm also then well aware of the workflow and the workload of my colleagues and this helps me in not bothering them much for small tasks.",15/10/2019,"Pros: Easy to use, easy to set up Zapier integrations and email notifications. I like that you can set up specific projects available only for those involved but still visibile to anyone curious to know more.",Cons: Sometimes it induces in over producing tasks and chats with colleagues. Fast paced workers might find that it slows your workflow.
716,716 Asana,Asana,Paul H.,CEO,Telecommunications,2+ years,4,4,4,1,2,1,"“Asana good functionalities, bad customer support and a lousy customer agreement”","Overall: Good functionality abd ease of use, but lousy support and whatever money they collect they won't refund even if it's a mistake. I'm looking for another solution while writing this review.",8/10/2019,"Pros: Functionalities are great, it's versatile and easy to learn. It was a simple to implent software, the staff like the product and it really helped us to get organized.","Cons: Customer support was slow and not helpful at all. Replies happened 2 or 3 days later. I had a problem with an automatic charge which I disputed (not going into details) but I was able to cancel the service, however they kept the money towards future use. I like fast and customer centric services, Asana is not one of those."
717,717 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Internet,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“Best Project Management APP with beautiful design.”,,8/9/2019,,Cons: -Mobile notifications are not working. -a chat room and Direct Messaging between members would make the software greater. -Only 1 person can be responsible for a Task when you want to add tasks to multiple members you have to duplicate the task but afterwards you can not make edits on every task in once.
718,718 Asana,Asana,Dave A.,Digital Marketing Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,,4,9,“Freemium at it's best”,Overall: Great example of freemium software. It will make any team more productive but especially when there are task dependencies required to get projects successfully completed.,5/9/2019,"Pros: Asana has a clean interface with tons of features. The fact that you can be part of several independent teams is great, especially when working with several outside suppliers on different projects. The free version has a lot of features and will be sufficient for most teams, however your productivity goes into overdrive when you upgrade and unlock additional features like custom fields.",Cons: There are not many things that I don't like about this software. The only possible drawback might be that it can be a bit intimidating to new users. There are a lot of features which can be quite intimidating to users who lack confidence or are slow adopters.

With the help of this tool, I can easily create tasks and manage my projects in a simplified way. It allows me to keep a track of my working and co-relate with my professional colleagues in a more social and professional way.","Cons: After years of usage and completely addicted to this amazing collaborative tool, I have gain a broad perspective on how to flow things on my life. In all this tenure, I haven't faced any technical issue. There are some, but it depends on users like the user dashboard which is a little complicated, or 24/7 internet requirement."

I can also easily monitor my services and the teams with the help of this tool. This is quite an advanced tool with easy to access features.,30/7/2019,Pros: Asana provides the most convenient collaboration features which also allows us to collaborate and easily manage our projects and track the tasks. We can also easily get connected with our co-employees in order to stay updated with the organization. We have perform multi-operations at a time and can also customize the tool according to our requirement of the working routine.,Cons: Asana is not an easy to use tool and there's a steep curve in learning all of its management features. We also have to input lots of info and users requirements in order to get it initially setup .
721,721 Asana,Asana,Muhammad Arifur R.,Fellow,Environmental Services,2+ years,5,4,4,4,5,8,“Best workflow management platform”,Overall: I'm using it to collaborate with other members of my organization. It is a great platform for teamwork management.,27/7/2019,Pros: Asana let's you set tasks and many subtasks under the main task. It also lets you set due dates for all the tasks with appropriate description.,Cons: The free version is limited to a maximum of 5 collaborators. This makes it unsuitable for big projects with many collaborators unless you subscribe to its premium service.

We are a construction company, so 90% of our employees are out in the field. This gives us a platform to keep up on the progress of jobs, upload photos, etc., and it is easy to use and understand, once you get the basics down.","Cons: It can be confusing to get the gist of at first. While it's not easy to delete a task by accident, it can be easy to delete information inside a task, due to the auto-save feature. I also don't recall an ""undo"" feature, which would be helpful."

By the use of Asana we can manage the projects easily and wisely. The ability to add tasks, assign members, pass to QA, share the ticket to client etc. are some of the coolest features of Asana. We are using all these features and we are more happy with it as we can manage our projects wisely. Our issues/tickets are shared to the client and it can be reviewed by them more easily.",Cons: The major disadvantage is that the pricing plans are very high and it cannot be afforded for small companies. Please consider reducing the plan costs.
724,724 Asana,Asana,Douglas M.,Sales executive,Banking,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“Teams/tasks management software”,Overall: With asana you can easily spot a bottleneck in your team .Asana helps you manage your time and complete tasks in time as a team.This is just an amazing software that drives teams to success and attain their goals.Thanks to asana,6/5/2019,"Pros: Asana is straight to the point from the time you start using it.It organizes your tasks in a convenient and effective mode.Asana is cloud based and it keeps you on point about any edits ,comments,important dates or any task. A great collaborative tool for teams to share documents ,files,ideas,and updates on tasks assigned,adding subtasks to main task.Integrates so well with your email.",Cons: So far so good.Asana is a great software especially for small teams.
725,725 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,4,,,10,“Useful Team Project Management Tool But Needs Better Mobile Experience ”,,29/4/2019,,"Cons: Asana could greatly improve its mobile experience. They have a smartphone app. However, not all functionality is available in the app including some pretty basic text editing functions. I have also had multiple instances where a teammate has commented on a task, but the app does not send me a notification. Also be forewarned that once you set up a project with either the list or board layout, you cannot change it later."
726,726 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Management Consulting,2+ years,5,5,5,3,4,10,“Tool that never lets me forget”,Overall: I use Asana to manage my day to day project work and document key milestone dates. It kind of acts as my personal assistant and helps me not forget my deadlines,16/4/2019,"Pros: The tool creates a calendar view automatically as and when you create new tasks for yourself or the team. The gantt chart view is also good. But I like the calendar view more. It is interactive as well. I also like the entire UI of this tool because it is really easy to create tasks without much overhead. The navigation, speed is excellent. The other feature I like about Asana is the ability to set a task as a repeat task. I can schedule a task weekly. So if I mark a task as complete for current week, and if I have scheduled it for weekly then a new task will be created automatically with a new deadline of next week.","Cons: The integration of calendar on Asana with outlook is not so smooth. There is a way of syncing both of them but it is not automatic. Also, summary dashboards on Asana is not an easy thing. So, if I need to know how many tasks were created, how many completed and how many pending, then I need to do that out side of the system."
727,727 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Perfect tool to keep your team on the same page!”,"Overall: Asana has been an incredible addition to our team and has kept us all in check. Instead of worrying about hiccups due to a missed deadline, we're all on the same page and focused on the future and new projects",20/3/2019,"Pros: Asana has brought organization to my marketing department in the cleanest, easiest, brightest way possible! I work at a start-up where there are a million things going on all at once, but we all need to remain in coordination! Asana works MAGIC to keep all projects organized, with subtasks easy to add so that things can get done on time.",Cons: The only negative thing that I can think of is that 1. you can't export the calendar to use in presentations (we present marketing plans to sales a lot) and 2. more colors available for projects! (we have a lot of different segments for projects and have run out of colors. (:
728,728 Asana,Asana,Daria K.,Business Owner,Arts and Crafts,2+ years,5,5,3,5,5,8,"“Great app, but could be improved ”",Overall: I enjoy Asana and can't believe that it's free. To me that is the best free notes app to get your stuff done.,19/2/2019,Pros: I love this app for their calendar. It's useful to be able to include the deadline for the projects. It's also satisfying to have different folders and be able to check the tasts you've completed. It's very easy to send tasks to your group and watch it being completed.,"Cons: The board mode. It doesn't look like a board and if you attach a picture to the task you can't see it while viewing the board. It also bothers me that you can't view the whole boards, you can only view 1 sticker at the time. This could've been done so much better."
729,729 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Networking,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Great basic project management tool”,"Overall: Asana has allowed us to realize efficiencies across the board. It allows us to have a quick, easy-to-use tool that saves time by keeping track of who is on first and who is responsible for each stage of a project. Asana's great reminder tools generally keep everyone on task, which saves additional effort.",13/2/2019,Pros: I like to describe Asana as a project management tool for people who don't use project management tools. It's really visual and easy to use. I've used it with noobs to project management to inject a cadence of accountability into projects and collaborative work.,Cons: The only thing I've complained about is the limited number of team members who can collaborate on a free account. But that's just me being cheap!
730,730 Asana,Asana,Nick D.,Creative Lead,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,3,4,5,8,“A simple on the surface but surprisingly complex task management tool.”,Overall: Very positive. Was a heavy Trello user in the past (another great product) but Trello did feel very limited in it's capabilities. Asana works much better for a busy agency environment.,18/1/2019,Pros: The key feature that I like is the ability to set of different boards for each client and also boards that relate to specific areas of our business and be able to tie them all together. Also the MOBILE APP. The design has been brilliantly thought out and it's just as powerful as the full desktop version. No watering down but still just as easy to use.,"Cons: In parts, it gets overly complex. This is not a huge complaint because I just choose not to use the features that I find too complex, but some of our team members have requested we use dependencies and a few of the other features and that's when it becomes too much work to keep everything in order."
731,731 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Telecommunications,2+ years,4,4,4,4,5,8,“Alternative internal communication tool”,Overall: it must continue to improve because it promises many positive things in the world organizations as a project manager.,12/12/2018,"Pros: It is a tool that I have not had the opportunity to administer, but I had the opportunity to be a user, so I am very interested in your proposal, that is, it has the advantage of being free and easily accessible, in my opinion. You can see yourself as a mini administrator of projects or tasks, I also really like the way you can shape the user interface to your liking without any limitation and, finally, I find its innovation excellent with a version for organizations and large projects. Personally I can recommend it in the organization for which I work with telecommunications projects. also its main advantage is the work in conjunction with cloud computing, helping to monitor projects from the web application to the mobile from anywhere.","Cons: Asana is software that can give much to talk about in the future; however, in the present they are limiting a lot in the labor field; in view of being free, it only limits a group of a maximum of 15 people for its use, since in addition to its English language, which in some parts of the world can not be applied, it must generate a series of main languages that can be useful for the tool, in other aspects, despite being easy to use, it generates inconveniences to give it maximum use, so it is necessary to process a repository of codes and management diagrams for the technological community."
732,732 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Insurance,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Forget Project Management - Try Life Management”,,24/9/2018,,"Cons: I really can't think of anything. I wish the push notification were a little more prdictive, like as my list for the dwindles give me an idea of what I should do for tomorrow."
733,733 Asana,Asana,Jamison D.,Director of Email Marketing Strategy,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,3,3,10,“The Best Project Management Tool We've Used”,Overall: My overall experience has been great. We have seen that our projects stay moving forward and task get completed much sooner. Everyone here loves to work with Asana and we plan on keeping it for a long time.,27/8/2018,Pros: We like most that the application is free to use and can accommodate most all of our project needs. We are a small digital marketing shop and we needed something to help us stay organized when we have multiple people working on a project. Most of our team members work remotely and the Asana application helps us get our work done and track our progress from task to task.,"Cons: It's a little confusing setting it up in the beginning. You can create teams and then add task and assign to your team members, Once you get the just of it then its really easy to work with. Just takes a bit to get going with new people having to learn how it works."
734,734 Asana,Asana,Allyssa E.,Visual Designer,Graphic Design,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“The best task management I've used at work ever”,,4/5/2018,,"Cons: Nothing to complain about. I miss the unicorns! But in all seriousness, I don't like the weird buggyness you get when you connect Okta with Asana."
735,735 Asana,Asana,Chandra M.,manager,Health,2+ years,5,4,5,,5,10,"“Asana is an extremely useful, multifunctional tool, especially if you care about paper conservation.”","Overall: Too many to list! It is my most useful tool at work. I can communicate with my team remotely, leave notes for them, reduce paper consumption, and even stay in touch on the go with the app. CAn;t recommend it highly enough.",7/3/2018,"Pros: Multiple functions: inter-office memos, to-do list, calendar, you can set reminders, assign your teammates tasks, I use it for everything at work. It has drastically reduced my paper consumption. I also like the customizable appearance and fun animated celbrations you get when you complete a task.",Cons: The app. The desktop version is much more functional and user-friendly. I also wish there were more animated display settings; the bats and snow are my favorite display themes.
736,736 Asana,Asana,Eduardo R.,Head of Sales,Computer Software,2+ years,5,3,5,5,3,9,“Auto-save projects without any problem at Asana.”,"Overall: Asana is very good software, it only has a minimum negative factor that in the long term, could affect it a lot, are its prices. Asana has benefited me a lot in my work area, since I have been able to contribute more realistic projects, and thanks to these projects, I have attracted more attention and more interested public in what I do.",20/2/2018,"Pros: I really like Asana's auto-save, since on several occasions, I have completely lost my computer connection, and I did not have time to save the project, this is not a problem with Asana, since the self-saving that it has, helps a lot in this area of work","Cons: I do not like the prices of Asana, I have thoroughly investigated each of the benefits offered from the basic plan, to the premium, and none of them provides the correct benefits to use 100% Asana, I would like to lower the prices or add more features in each work plan."
737,737 Asana,Asana,Michael A.,Finance Manager,E-Learning,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Project collaboration and task management made easy”,Overall: Easily manage your tasks. Helps you prioritize one off tasks or projects.,15/2/2018,Pros: I love this tool as an alternative to email. This tool allows you to create tasks for yourself or other individuals. You can set due dates and times. You also have the ability to collaborate within the tool. This also works extremely well for Projects where there are multiple people responsible for taking it through to the end.,"Cons: This may not be a con, if it is a feature I haven't discovered yet. But, it would be nice if there was desktop alerts to tasks that had due dates or times. In other words, you have to be in the program to effectively manage and prioritize your tasks."
738,738 Asana,Asana,Peter Z.,Senior Accountant,1-10 employees,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,8,“Modern software for tasks monitoring”,Overall: The good application helps the team in the work and makes it simple and very effective.,9/2/2018,"Pros: Working in a team and building a business is always not just necessary to always be aware of new products in order to keep up with competitors. That's why the most effective tools are needed for work. Asana application I chose together with the team is a modern tool for project management online. We chose this application, because it's easy to manage, you do not have to sit for long and deal with all its functions. For us, simple and quick work is very important. Another plus of the application is the availability of a free version of it is quite enough for me and my team.","Cons: Email notifications work poorly. This, perhaps, is the only drawback, which in due course must be eliminated. Then the program will be perfect."
739,739 Asana,Asana,John C.,CEO & Director (Programs),Professional Training & Coaching,2+ years,5,5,5,4,,,“Absolutely elite”,Overall: Great for small teams or large ones. But either way (as with any task management system) it's the cultural change associated with adoption that's really important. And Asana's videos make that really clear. Splendid platform. The free version is richly featured - and ideal for small teams and the paid version has great features for larger ones. Asana has managed this step-up perfectly.,8/8/2017,"Pros: Way too many to list. Simplicity, flexibility and reliability being the main ones. Another being the the option to invite others in to particular areas for collaborations.",Cons: Very few that I can think of. If Asana could find a way to integrate my email inbox it'd be Nirvana. But the forward emails isn't so bad.
740,740 Asana,Asana,Craig D.,Owner,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Couldn't function without it.”,Overall: We use Asana in every aspect of our company. It's been a life-saver for us. It's clear that the team at Asana has taken a lot of attention to every single project management scenario.,6/12/2016,"Pros: How much it helps us get things done in an organized, centralized way. The small little details that have been put into the software -- like saving a comment by a user even though they haven't hit the comment button. Even the app has gone through some huge changes that have improved things.",Cons: I wish I better understood how to use the dashboard and reporting to see a better snapshot of our company on a given day.
741,741 Asana,Asana,Carl R.,National Manager Analytics,Insurance,2+ years,5,4,4,4,5,9,“An Agile Enabler for Team Projects and Service Requests”,Overall: We really like ASANA since we first started using it back in 2014. Our team in New Zealand was split between two locations following an acquisition and the emails were piling up. ASANA allowed us to (almost) eliminate emails within the team. That allowed for better management and ultimately improved deliverables from the team. Capacity was quickly used up as we were able to develop a service ticket system to manage customer requests. The ability to search and monitor workloads is a great performance and project management tool as well.,3/11/2016,"Pros: Easy to use, online and available via mobile app.",Cons: Load time is sometime slow. The kanban integration should be native as the current integration is a bit clunky.
742,742 Asana,Asana,Christopher J.,Senior Graphic Designer,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“Keeps us organized as an Agency!”,"Overall: From the time we started with Asana it wasn't ideal but once the brand and interfaced changed, it was a true upgrade! We are able to keep all of our clients & clients jobs organized for our team. An individuals tasks is the best way to view what you have going! The only downfall is notifications when something is updated on a project you follow! GIVE ME DESKTOP NOTIFICATIONS ALREADY! Other than that we love it",3/11/2016,"Pros: The organization of the platform, and the options on how to structure/organize your information (Projects, tagging, custom fields, subtasks, etc.).",Cons: The notifications aren't in our face enough. If I follow a task I want to know when something is updated. I don't like having to stay in my email to know if something has changed. The way gmail desktop notifications are is how I envision the notifications working. Push notification and I click straight through and it opens up Asana straight to the task.
743,743 Asana,Asana,Chandan S.,Principal Engineer,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,4,4,4,10,“Great for small focussed projects”,"Overall: We love to use Asana for our sprint planning on multiple projects in our org. For short sprints with small teams, this works really great. The slick UI which is very fast and the simplicity of the UI are the main things that work for us. We have not found Asana to scale for large complex cross-functional projects. But for small teams which work on very focussed features and tasks, this is a killer app for planning and execution.",3/11/2016,"Pros: - fast UI. - Simplicity - very easy to create tasks, close them, assign them, punt them etc. - Good collaboration features for small teams",Cons: - Does not work well for large cross-functional projects - Not easy to track complex interdependencies between tasks.
744,744 Asana,Asana,Meghan S.,Marketing Specialist,51-200 employees,2+ years,4,4,3,3,4,7,“Great for Collaboration on Small Teams”,"Overall: I do marketing and graphic design. My previous employer used JIRA for task management across the entire company'whether you were a software engineer or photographer. JIRA was overly complicated for our quick tasks and fairly small workflow. When I came to my current employer and was introduced to Asana, my world changed. I thought that managing a workflow had to be complicated, full of a lot of logic, and take a long time to set up. Not so with Asana! This program is easy-to-use and quick to explain. We have a ton of projects set up along with 5-10 team members, and the interface allows you to quickly see who is assigned to the task, the due date, and description. When the task needs to move to another project or assignee, you can simply drag the entire item to wherever it needs to go. I didn't even mention that most of the features are free'perfect for smaller organizations who may not have the budget to spend on overly complicated software.",5/10/2016,Pros: - Easy to use - Great user interface,Cons: - No built-in time tracker
745,745 Asana,Asana,Bryan K.,Director of Production,Food & Beverages,2+ years,5,4,5,,4,9,“Best task management software for any level. ”,"Overall: Once I understood Asana, it became essential for me to complete my work as I juggle work in multiple products.",27/10/2020,"Pros: Very easy to use. Integrates with Gmail, Slack, and many more. You can create tasks to repeat, be one off, have followers, etc.","Cons: No cons, the only thing that could be better is notifications are not super intuitive."
746,746 Asana,Asana,Alita D.,Office Manager,Construction,2+ years,5,5,4,,,10,“A must for task management and organization”,Overall: I use Asana daily to corrdinate tasks assigned to me via email. I am able to set that task to a different staff member and get updates (also via email) as to the progress and completiton. For someone that is on their email all day long it is a life-saver. I never miss a beat,16/9/2020,"Pros: Asana works great to connect multiple people to a project, track progress, store and communication information and documentation. It also sync's with G Suite which is a lifesaver if you get emailed work requests.",Cons: The search capability needs improvement. Sometimes I need to go back and see what was done on a completed task and it is really difficult to find the correct one in the search.
747,747 Asana,Asana,Chuck P.,Marketing and Creative Director,Food Production,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Asana to the rescue”,"Overall: Asana fits our needs to a tee. Both now and as we grow. It was easy to get up and running and we had our extensive list of projects listed in no time at all. Our five person marketing team continues to use it daily and we have not had a glitch or single problem with it. We look forward to learning all of the great aspects of this software for it has already proven to help us be more efficient and able to track our projects with ease, and best of all is a great tool for reporting to higher ups in management.",25/6/2020,"Pros: We needed a project management software that was easy to use, quick to implement and cost effective. After extensive research we found Asana to check all of the boxes.","Cons: So far there is nothing that we don not like. While we have not gotten into the weeds of all the features (which there are many), there is nothing we do not like about this great program."
748,748 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Wholesale,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Works with GTD”,"Overall: Asana has been a great addition to my workflow. It has been easy to use and implement in my daily life, both personal and work.",13/4/2020,Pros: If you're accustomed to the GTD method this app will serve you well. Able to sync to Google Calendar. gMail integration.,Cons: Sometimes the app goes offline due to server overloads but it usually comes back soon.
749,749 Asana,Asana,Ingrid U.,owner,Design,2+ years,5,5,5,,4,10,“Love it for any size busienss!”,Overall: I love it. My OBM recommended it and it was a learning curve coming from Trello but it has been the best decision ever,7/4/2020,Pros: Love the projects and how each one can have independent users so it's super focused on what we are working on. And the new option to switch between board and list view is the BEST thing ever,"Cons: The search feature is a bit off, even when you search with exact words and terms, it's kind of missing tasks that contain those words."
750,750 Asana,Asana,Karen L.,Operations Manager,Fund-Raising,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Asana helps us be organized”,Overall: We have used Asana for less than six months so I'm still learning it. I have really enjoyed everything I've experienced thus far and I feel strongly that Asana will only help us become a more efficient and successful company.,27/3/2020,"Pros: We are a remote company, therefore, it's very difficult for us to all be on the same page during projects and engagements. Asana allows us to see each project in its entirety, the status of each task, and who is assigned to complete each task. Being real-time, we can know where a project is at any given moment.","Cons: We have used Asana for less than six months so I can't really say what I like least about it, as I'm still learning it. I have really enjoyed everything I've experienced thus far."
751,751 Asana,Asana,Wally S.,Sr. Data Warehosue Engineer,Real Estate,2+ years,4,3,3,,,6,“Asana project/agile management software”,"Overall: We are trying to make sure we have a basic understanding of what we need to get done, what is currently under construction and what we have done. Asana does allow for these things to be accomplished, it is just a little difficult for me to wrap my head around how its purpose really helps our overall productivity rates.",24/3/2020,Pros: How easy it is to bucket or silo tasks. I also like the ease of creating subtasks within the main tasks.,Cons: It is sometimes fairly difficult to find things. I would also like to be able to link Asana tasks to other pieces of software that we use to keep track of our work. I feel that overall it is somewhat less intuitive than other agile software I have used in the past.
752,752 Asana,Asana,Yair K.,Head of Marketing,Utilities,2+ years,4,5,4,4,5,8,"“Does what it says it does, and does it best”","Overall: I love it, even though the price is a bit high for the pro versions",20/3/2020,"Pros: I love how simple it is to use, how you can add an assignment to your teammates at no time and check out your tasks once done","Cons: I think it's a little pricey, and the minimum teammates rule for the pro version is not a good idea"
753,753 Asana,Asana,Andreia P.,Freelancer,Translation and Localization,2+ years,5,5,4,4,,8,“Organization and project management made easy”,Overall:,6/2/2020,"Pros: I like its functionality, the fact that it's easy to use and available on my desktop and mobile devices. It made project management easier for me and some of my clients since it allows us to easily and quickly exchange messages and files, establish deadlines, assign users, create associated subtasks on projects, etc.","Cons: Sometimes there is some sort of bug and I don't receive all of my notifications for new tasks or messages. The customer support usually fixes it, but sometimes the problem reappears."
754,754 Asana,Asana,Elizabeth N.,Payroll Manager,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,7,“Great project Management system”,Overall: Its been good. It has created a space for the organization to work together and collaborate that is more efficient than just email,31/1/2020,Pros: I like that we have the ability to connect with our team in such a seamless way. Being able to assign tasks and create teams has been a huge help in making sure that projects work on the timeline needed.,Cons: there is a little bit of a learning curve to using the program. It took a little bit to create the right workflows and get everyone trained
755,755 Asana,Asana,Josh R.,COO,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Works great”,,27/12/2019,,Cons: No problems with it yet. It does everything we need it to.
756,756 Asana,Asana,Adelyn C.,d.Leadership Co President,Education Management,2+ years,5,3,5,,,9,"“Lots of features and high functionality, but a little confusing at first glance”","Overall: Setting very tangible deadlines and seeing who is assigned to what project is very useful and having a software where everyone can see who is responsible for what seems to give off this energy that makes people really internalize that they need to get their tasks done. It definitely increases productivity and task turnaround, as well as improving employee accountability.",23/12/2019,"Pros: You can create a lot of sub-projects within a team and I think that's really fascinating, and you can also view everything in a calendar which makes streamlining processes and due dates so much easier. Plus, within each project, you can look at a timeline, which I love, and a lot of other softwares don't have this feature.","Cons: There's a lot to unpack when you first try using Asana, and I think that it can be a little bit offputting at first because many teams who start using it are looking to jump right in without needing to ""train"" their team members on how to use software too much (after all, that would take a lot of valuable time which basically defeats the purpose of the software itself). With a little bit of invested time and energy, though, the product becomes really useful."

758,758 Asana,Asana,Meg L.,Events Director,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,4,,9,“Asana is like another team member”,"Overall: Asana streamlines our project updates and questions, allows us to share files, and keep everyone in the loop without bogging down email too bad.",3/12/2019,Pros: Our team heavily relies on Asana for all our project management and organization. We joke that she's like the extra team member that we couldn't work without. Asana is extremely easy to learn and is very intuitive. They also continually are making updates to improve their software and listening to the user's feedback.,"Cons: I wish you could sort by due date within a projects section. But I do know this is something they are working on, so I hope to see the feature integrated soon!"
759,759 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,5,3,,5,6,"“Good Product, But Not Sophisticated Enough For Me”","Overall: We needed a solution for task and project management. This worked well for a while but as we spent more time using it, we realized we needed something more complex.",4/10/2019,Pros: It's easy to use and looks great. It's a basic to-do list type of software that allows you to incorporate basic collaboration with team members.,Cons: It's not very sophisticated. Not a lot of reporting available. Not as an organization or group-friendly as other software.
760,760 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Arts and Crafts,2+ years,4,3,4,,,7,“It's convenient but it takes a bit of time to learn”,Overall: I found it and implemented it for the company and I had to teach them all how to use it. Once we got in a flow it was very helpful and convenient and I would suggest it to someone else.,22/9/2019,"Pros: I love that it is in the format of a calendar and the other features that come along with it. It's not just a calendar and its not just for organizing or keeping meetings straight; you can have conversations between other users/employees and you can assign tasks to people, which I love, that is very convenient and something that other platforms do not have.",Cons: It takes awhile to learn and get used to and I've had trouble teaching other employees about it. Some get frustrated with it so I guess it is just not user friendly enough. And I don't think the app version works as well.
761,761 Asana,Asana,Sam L.,Director of Paid Media,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Extremely simple to use and well integrated”,Overall: Super simple project management tool. Recommend it for almost all companies of reasonable size.,21/9/2019,"Pros: One of the hidden features of Asana is its vast amount of Zapier integrations with other software, especially Slack.","Cons: Asana has a few paid features that are extremely simple that should probably be free, and vice-versa with free features."
762,762 Asana,Asana,Davit K.,Software Engineer,Telecommunications,2+ years,4,5,5,3,4,9,"“A user-friendly, feature-rich project management tool for all your needs.”","Overall: I'm loving Asana, so far. I've only had a single problem and customer support, even though they took their time, solved it for me. Asana offers all the features I might need and more. I definitely recommend using it.",16/9/2019,"Pros: Asana makes one of the most dreaded tasks fun - project management. It has a smorgasbord of features that greatly increases my productivity and makes it a delight to work. It's a bit harder than Trello, as it has some advanced features such as task assignment and etc. It also has a free trial plan if you want to give it a try.","Cons: It's customer support is really slow and not very helpful, so you will have to rely on tutorials and FAQ."
763,763 Asana,Asana,Naomi Y.,Software Engineer,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,4,4,3,,,7,“Productive tool!”,,6/8/2019,,"Cons: I didn't like how it could not merge calendars and had too many automated email alerts. A few nuisances within the tool itself could be better fleshed out to accommodate our team's specific needs, but as an overall tool for general project and product manager, it has been very productive"
764,764 Asana,Asana,Charlotte B.,Software Programmer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,4,3,4,9,“Awesome PM tool!”,Overall: Our experience is wonderful because our teams are more productive now.,3/8/2019,"Pros: We have different group of teams working on multiple projects at a time. Sometimes it is difficult to keep a track of all the ongoing projects, but Asana makes it super easy to look over all the teams and assigned tasks. We can track and monitor progress of each task and set the deadlines to complete projects, which really help in keeping the teams motivated. Hence, Asana is the best project management tool.",Cons: The area of improvement would be to provide the ability to customize the tasks view and themes. I would love this improvement.
765,765 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,3,5,9,“Better than trello”,Overall: It was a great alternative to Trello and had more functionality that allowed you to manage progress and tickets better,3/8/2019,"Pros: Asana is like Trello, except it's got waaaaay more features that help you manage tickets. Asana allows you to manage tickets that are dependent of each other and as such will allow you to see a better flow of progress.",Cons: The bigger your team the more you'll have to pay. Asana's biggest downfall is having to pay to have more people on a single team. As most of the functionality doesn't come in trial.
766,766 Asana,Asana,Peter D.,Senior Software Engineer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“The tool fits to all of our team collaoration needs”,"Overall: With the help of Asana , we organize our way of working and collab with the other team members. It saves us from lots of hassle and provides the most helpful platform.",30/7/2019,Pros: Asana is a very dynamic collaboration tool which allows us to manage and connect in a reliable way. We can mostly organize our work and projects in the easiest of ways and can produce more efficiency in our work. We can stay connected with our team round the clock and can appoint tasks to the team members in the most reliable way.,"Cons: This tool has been continuouslu updated with lots of features addition. It is a very helpful tool which be used for socializing at the workplace and collaoration on the projects. So far , I cannot compose any kinds of cons related to it because it always fits best to my working needs."
767,767 Asana,Asana,Karlo G.,Risk Operations Analyst,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“Asana user review”,"Overall: I hope that the software could improve more on the ease of access because as a user, the entire picture of the software needs to be understood instantly or at least almost.",21/7/2019,"Pros: This is my daily task management software and I love every feature that it offers. I use it to manage and monitor important tasks that needs to get done. It is very easy to use, runs smoothly and you can even have conversations and request forms on it like google forms. If possible, this app could be used on almost all necessary workflow.","Cons: As compared to other apps that offer the same use, I could say that it is not the easiest to use. I had to spend almost two days intermittently using the software to get the clear picture on how it works. Google keep is way easier and I wished they could do the same, interface wise."
768,768 Asana,Asana,Natasha B.,Owner,Management Consulting,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“Best PM System I have used”,Overall: I use Asana for both business & personal planning. It works that well. And I can check things on the mobile app if I am on the go.,26/5/2019,"Pros: I love that Asana allows you to fully map out a project with sections, subtasks & milestones that you can see in a timeline. The recurring task feature has been a life saver for me. If I know something has to be done, daily, weekly, monthly, annually, etc. I just set it & forget it until Asana reminds me. Asana also integrates with so many other web-based tools. It really is one of the most user-friendly PM systems.",Cons: That I cannot share templates across different workspaces.
769,769 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,5,,,10,“Best project management tool out there”,Overall: Asana has changed the way I work. It's made it possible for me to juggle several different projects at once without missing deadlines. I would be totally overwhelmed and lost without Asana.,14/5/2019,"Pros: Asana has been the easiest tool I've found to coordinate projects. It gives me the ability to organize projects from the highest level down to the most granular of details, all with deadlines, assignees, and multiple view options.","Cons: It can be a little clunky to navigate when adding new tasks. I don't like that I usually have to navigate to ""list"" view in order to add a new task. I like to be in calendar view and stay there, but this isn't easily possible."
770,770 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,4,,,9,“Easy project management tool”,Overall: I love the tool and highly recommend it (especially for startups),11/4/2019,"Pros: - Asana allows me to check on the status of any project without bothering my colleagues. - User interface design is important for any project management tool. And, this one is beautiful. It might not be robust enough to track development projects but you can definitely use this for marketing, sales, funding, etc. - Asana's functions are easy to use: click, drag, check off etc","Cons: - lack of burndown chart - Asana doesn't report a completed project on a calendar. As a result, the user will still need to manually track when what is done when."
771,771 Asana,Asana,Bryn S.,Creative Consultant,Graphic Design,2+ years,4,4,3,,,7,“Asana for small business”,Overall:,7/4/2019,"Pros: It is nice to be able to chat with your team so easily and post all updates somewhere other than an email inbox since that pretty much just litters your inbox with way too much info. Also the fact that you can upload pretty large files helps a lot, I am a graphic designer so I tend to send large files, I can attach much more content here than say in an email. Also it is nice to be able to integrate the calendar with your google calendar.","Cons: I do wish there were a few more features; like ranking in priority, having a main task yet in the same place on the same feed sub tasks so you can mark off your section as done, also the ability to remove yourself from a task once you are done because when others are still working on it and commenting on it, it continues to show up in your inbox."
772,772 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,4,4,4,9,“Task Collaboration + Task Management = Improved Productivity”,Overall: We started using Asana around 2 years ago when our team was growing and we had multi-phase deliveries in pipeline. Asana has helped us work better as team and improve overall team productivity.,28/3/2019,Pros: Asana is a task collaboration software that lets you assign tasks and track to closure. This helps in avoiding personal meetings and email follow ups. Asana helps improve team productivity. The reports in Asana on task status are useful in project status update meetings. Asana also has a very handy mobile app which let's you update tasks and status within the reach of your mobile device.,"Cons: Asana started with a big bang and there was a lot of buzz about it. Unfortunately for Asana, lot of other people copied the idea and improved on it. Asana needs to work on its visual appeal and reporting features."
773,773 Asana,Asana,Sarah L.,CSR,Telecommunications,2+ years,4,5,4,,,9,“Great for Task Management both Personal and Professional”,"Overall: Asana is great for both business and potentially personal use. I prefer its personal interface compared to other project management applications, and it's flexibility with organizing the tasks to your individual taste is great. It has a social media feel which is surprisingly familiar, so there is little to no learning curve. I enjoy how thorough the pre-fab modules are and find they accomodate the information I need to fill in for a myriad of types of jobs. The app needs some work in regards to being a lateral transition from the website, but all in all it's solid software.",28/2/2019,"Pros: The interface is gorgeous and very intuitive. I was able to learn and understand the features from the beginning. I primarily use the Asana website however having an app to use on the go is a wonderful feature. I enjoy how easy it is to distribute tasks with my team members and being able to organize the tasks in different folders and columns is great. I could see myself using this for personal projects as well! I really enjoy the options within a task that can be configured, so I'm able to track progress and add links/resources as needed.","Cons: The app could use some work; Features are limited and it does not show tasks the same way the website does. I understand needing to change the format to fit a mobile screen, but it would be more fluid work-wise for the formatting to be more lateral."
774,774 Asana,Asana,Whitney W.,Talent Acquisition Specialist,51-200 employees,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“I love Asana!”,,21/2/2019,,"Cons: I really can't think of anything wrong with Asana. I wish more people on my team would use it, but I'm perfectly fine keeping this wonderful secret to myself"
775,775 Asana,Asana,Dustin R.,President,Retail,2+ years,5,5,5,,4,10,“Asana was the tool we needed to get our team IN SYNC”,Overall: Asana has been a wonderful program for delegating tasks to team members and ensuring that everyone knows what is expected of them. It has been very helpful for me as an business owner but has also been well received from our employees. Asana is their home base to start/end their workday and keeps all of us IN SYNC with our short and long term objectives,5/2/2019,Pros: Very user friendly interface. It is easy to navigate and makes quickly adding tasks for team members a breeze. Great mobile app,Cons: The program is fairly robust and offers A LOT of options that our small team does not currently use. I would like to see an option to disable some of these views/features in an effort to keep a minimalist design
776,776 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Higher Education,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Powerful team-based project management software”,"Overall: I have used Asana as a project management software in a team setting, as well as an individual to-do list for personal and professional tasks. In both contexts it is a great mix of powerful and simple. I use it now primarily for personal to-do management, and it is so fast and easy to use for this purpose. Wonderfully designed software.",3/2/2019,Pros: I love that Asana makes it easy to coordinate project management across members of a large team. It is easy to delegate work and see what is being done at a glance.,"Cons: There are tons of features, so there is a bit of a learning curve. However, the features are laid out pretty intuitively and I think the software is designed very well."
777,777 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Hospitality,2+ years,4,4,3,3,5,6,“Asana good but needs a better way to organize projects”,Overall: This has helped our team streamline our tasks and helps ensure we are all getting our jobs done on time and completing our projects effeciently.,15/1/2019,Pros: Great for creating task lists and assigning them to team members Helps our team to know what is due and who is responsible for each task Keeps a good history of what has happened to make research easier,Cons: There needs to be a way to organize the view by numerical order. We name our projects by dates and we have to move them into the order they belong manually. It would be easier to look at if we could put a folder under a project so we could consolidate things better so it is easier to look at.
778,778 Asana,Asana,Erin K.,Manager,Retail,2+ years,5,5,5,5,3,7,“Lovely App/Easy to Use”,"Overall: I used Asana in business previously. We had several administrative tasks with volunteers coming and going through the week. This was a great way to make sure ll the menial tasks got done and to communicate anything that needed to be communicated to the business owners, the staff, the volunteers, etc. Very efficient. Later used the free version at my home when my roommates were fresh out of college and needed a little guidance on what home tasks needed to be done how often.",2/1/2019,"Pros: Very pretty layout, very ""femme"" office oriented which makes it easier on the eyes, great features, easy to use/understand/get several tasks done.","Cons: My only desire for change in this app is that I wish there were more available for the free version. I used one account for my business and one for home, but I realized that other apps that were similar had a lot more features on their free versions"
779,779 Asana,Asana,Tatianna H.,Director of Digital Marketing,E-Learning,2+ years,5,4,5,,5,9,“Valuable for Business Management and Tracking”,Overall:,18/12/2018,Pros: This software is free to use for small teams and is a powerfull tool to help everyone stay organized and on task.,"Cons: The UI/UX can be a bit confusing depending on what you want to use the platform for, and it can be quite cumbersome when finding comments/posts/tasks/lists since there's an edless combination of options. They also incorporated ""stream"" like features similar to Trello, which was nice, but didn't really add to the overall experience."
780,780 Asana,Asana,Andrew F.,Project Manager,Real Estate,2+ years,4,5,3,4,5,8,“Asana as Basic User”,"Overall: Asana has helped to organize my life by consolidating all of my To-Do items into one platform. I used to have papers all over the place outlining next-steps for our various company projects. Now, I can keep all items in one place and flip through projects in seconds to see what needs to be done and where my teammates are on their items.",12/12/2018,"Pros: Very easy to use and understand. Simple interface. I like the connectivity to other programs (gmail, google calendar). Dated task lists are amazing","Cons: The attached file system is clunky and difficult to use. Also, I don't like that you can't right-click on items for more options. Also can't select and manipulate multiple tasks at once."
781,781 Asana,Asana,Anastasia V.,Chief Marketing Officer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Love Asana for Group Collaboration and Project Management”,Overall: We've been able to have our team remain empowered and accountable by managing their own tasks and engaging team members if they need help. All of this is tracked within the system. Excellent tool,11/10/2018,"Pros: The flexibility to add projects and tasks on the fly, easy assignments, tracking of due dates, inclusion of project deliverables/assets is amazing. Super easy to use and it takes about 5 minutes to get up to speed.","Cons: Would love to see some more forecasting and high end project management capabilities. As a very busy team we have many projects on the go and it would be great to have programmatic insight into workload, conflicting dates/deliverables and timeframes."
782,782 Asana,Asana,Radu O.,CEO,Internet,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“Probably the best task manager for more advanced teams”,,6/10/2018,,Cons: The only thing keeping me from using Asana for any project (not just team projects) is that it doesn't offer reminders for tasks due at a certain time (e.g. receive a push notification when you have a task due on Monday at 11:00 am).
783,783 Asana,Asana,Holly M.,Owner/Designer,Retail,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“My go-to to-do list”,"Overall: LOVE it. When a fellow entrepreneur introduced me to Asana, it BLEW my mind. I use it for my super master to-do list, ranging from high-level, long-term goals, to small, recurring tasks I need to do daily. Asana makes it easy to add other folks and projects and (my favorite) drill down and break up a big task into a bunch of smaller ones. Cuz that's how my business is run- little by little by little. :)",21/8/2018,"Pros: SO many things! The user interface is the best...and come on, who doesn't love rainbows and unicorns dancing across the screen when you mark a todo as complete?","Cons: When copying projects (I'm using the free version, and I know the paid tiers offer this), it's a little clunky to copy them smoothly."
784,784 Asana,Asana,Alicia P.,Account & social media coordinator,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,10,"“It makes it easy for our whole team to communicate, collaborate & stay organized with many projects.”","Overall: It makes my every day easier. It keeps me on track when I have many open projects between multiple clients that I'm working on or trafficking. It also provides a central location to archive our task history, progressions, and for our teammates to collaborate and share.",30/7/2018,"Pros: It's easy to use and collaborate between multiple users. Our account coordinators are able to quickly and easily give tasks and directions to our graphic designers, and with ample storage space and an easy commenting feature we can keep our file sharing and progress on each project in one central location.",Cons: The search feature sometimes seems glitchy when looking for old jobs. Once a project is completed I've searched and had issues every now and then seeing the tasks and info within that job - sometimes in search t shows up but then when opened it is empty.
785,785 Asana,Asana,Mark L.,Marketing Strategist,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,4,4,10,“Best combination of ease-of-use and robust features”,Overall: The first task management tool that makes me feel on top of everything going on,22/7/2018,"Pros: I love Asana after the update they made about a year ago. They added a Kanban sort of element, and it connects really nicely into their original task management system. I've really got into the weeds with Asana and if you're using it to its full capacity, it's pretty amazingly feature-rich for how simple it to use.","Cons: Hard to really find legitimate downsides to it. It can get a bit pricey with lots of users, and requires buy-in and constant use from everyone to make it work, but that goes for any task management tool that isn't super basic."
786,786 Asana,Asana,Geronimo H.,Technical Account Manager,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,,“It made managing customers and their accounts so much easier”,,27/6/2018,,"Cons: At the time of use, we have moved to hubspot since then, there wasn't a way to export a project csv file to manage and import it back in to remove any old accounts. While it is easy to manage from within the interface, there are too many ""Are you sure"" prompts, yes I am sure hence why I am deleting them. Other than that it is a very solid software."
787,787 Asana,Asana,Oscar T.,Engineer,Internet,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,"“We plan ,organize and stay connected with Asana.”",,16/6/2018,,Cons: Asana presents teams with multiple capabilities and ways to accomplish project management. Thus it can quickly get confusing or complicated for new users ; who are yet to determine what Asana approach or configuration works best for them.
788,788 Asana,Asana,Jamie D.,"Learning Management System Administrator, Training Specialist",Machinery,2+ years,4,4,5,,5,8,“A robust task/project management platform for teams.”,Overall: Robust project/task management across our entire team. Integration with other popular tools. Mobile accessibility.,4/5/2018,"Pros: Asana is a powerful task/project management solution for teams. It has every feature you would possibly need to manage tasks. The new Timeline feature is nice and adds some more focus to the project management benefits of the tool. Asana has several integrations with other products as well. MS Office and Google to name a couple. The mobile app is responsive and gives you access on the go. If your company can afford it, you really can't go wrong with Asana.","Cons: Because it has so many features, I found that it did have a higher learning curve than some other products. Of course that can be overcome after some experience with the tool. The free version used to have more features to get started, but now you have to at least get the Premium membership to gain access to the strong tools. It can get a bit pricey /person/month."

Period”,"Overall: Being able to show the team how the pieces of a project fit together, and helps us keep work on track as things change.",2/5/2018,"Pros: Asana has saved so many of my projects especially when working with outsourcers - It allows me to keep all files on one place, integrate Google drive and create a realistic timeline with my team using the timeline feature. Asana keep getting better by adding features such has task dependency and it now integrates with Slack.",Cons: There are very few things i dislike about Slack but at the top of the list would be able to create and save my own project template and turn off/mute notifications for someone that is tag in a task.

Before Asana, I used to-do lists which were manually written on a notebook, which was dated for each day and colour coordinated, but SUPER manual. With Asana, I have all of that except it's online. I love that you can mark tasks that were assigned to you by another user as complete, and they are notified. Diminishes the back and forth emailing - but if they want to squeeze in a quick thank you, they can do that through Asana too! Love that I could also sign in from home and don't need to always remember to bring my to-do list with me! It's super easy to use, and it's clean, white lay out is just so aesthetically pleasing.",Cons: No cons just yet! I really do recommend this to any work place where there is a lot of back and forth in terms of task management. You will not regret it

Need to create another account and delete the old account."
792,792 Asana,Asana,Brady P.,,1-10 employees,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“Team Gamechanger”,,26/3/2018,,"Cons: - can only assign tasks to one person, multiple (rather than copy) would be better for our calendar as we use time blocking and multi-person tasks add an extra step when both team members have to check off complete - nothing else right now, still only a month in, haven't explored all use cases yet"

You have to create your own structure. If you can get over that hump, you'll be fine"
794,794 Asana,Asana,Claudia C.,SEO optimizer assistant,1-10 employees,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,9,“I really love this system”,,9/3/2018,,"Cons: Learning to work in it is sometimes more difficult than keeping GoogleTables. If the project people are not only from IT and the start time of the work is compressed, then I often choose other more understandable programs."
795,795 Asana,Asana,Chris V.,President,Design,2+ years,4,3,5,,5,7,"“Appears simple, but is really quite complex for better and worse”",,7/3/2018,,"Cons: Ultimately the advantages of the flexibility can also be a problem. It's so open and flexible that you really have to know how you want your tasks and projects organised. If you're someone like myself who doesn't have a lot of project management experience and is generally unorganised, implementing Asana really requires a lot of thought and energy to figure out how your projects should be set up. That can be exhausting and ultimately you might prefer more ""opinionated"" tools."
796,796 Asana,Asana,Joe M.,Head Estimator,Construction,2+ years,5,4,4,3,3,10,“Flexible to your Project Management Needs ”,Overall: Asana has a great free version that can be used indefinitely. There is a paid version that adds a lot of cool and useful features as well as an added layer of customer support. It all depends on your needs on whether you need the premium or free version.,12/12/2017,"Pros: Asana is very flexible. Many collaboration/project management/task assignment programs give you a very narrow scope of how you can organize your project. With Asana, you can turn a 'Project' into whatever you like. You can use the task as a place to store information. You can use a task to store someones contact info. I have used the 'Board' style project to keep up with the status of sales leads, moving them through the different stages of my process. Or you can just use the task as task :)","Cons: When you shrink your browser window size so you can fit other programs on your screen, it will cut down on how much you can see of the asana interface without being able see the rest unless you bring it back up to almost fullscreen."

It scales up quite easily and is very flexible”,,1/11/2017,,"Cons: It doesn't come with a stand-alone app, it's all web-browser managed. If you are off-line, you are stuck. Customer support is ok. It's a fast growing company so a lot of turns over in the support people so you don't end up being followed by somebody that knows your set-up."
798,798 Asana,Asana,jesse h.,Technology Solutions Manager,Unspecified,2+ years,4,5,3,4,,8,"“Very intuitive interface, with minimal effort to learn the platform”",,16/5/2017,,"Cons: The lack of custom meta data within tasks makes this software limited to management. You cannot add custom data in the way that you want it to be added for record keeping purposes, and the membership rights allows for anyone that is part of a task to have free reign on modifying data within the task."
799,799 Asana,Asana,Dave M.,HR business partner,Fund-Raising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“You guys are AMAZING!”,"Overall: Asana has changed my entire time / task management approach. I've always been a detailed and process oriented person. However, I lacked a software that could easy translate what was in my mind or on my yellow note pad into digital collaboration. I'm a raving fan of what you guys have created and continue to build! The more efficiency and effectiveness I have in the workplace, the more time I get to spend with my family outside of work. Thank you so much",6/12/2016,"Pros: Collaboration, ease of use, customizable approach.","Cons: Would like to see more ""Asana for dummies"" resources. In our office, about 1/2 the people have adopted it and about half are super intimidated by it. Without full adoption, I don't think the full potential of the software can be seen."

Being able to plug every task at hand from either my computer, phone, tablet, or email makes this product crucial to my day-to-day operation. With tags and assigning tasks to other individuals within the team, everyone stays on track and knows what steps are going on.",28/11/2016,"Pros: I love how Asana makes communication between me and my team seamless. Also, the easy layout makes me concentrate on each project and take it one step at a time. The way Asana is helping my team managing all our tasks is simple awesome. Its too easy to use and connects the entire team together.","Cons: Nothing particular, at the moment but I think if I had to say one thing it would be that the notifications are a bit heavy. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but sometimes having notification in your email, inbox logging on and calendar can feel a bit much."
801,801 Asana,Asana,Chase C.,COO,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Best PM Tool Out There”,Overall: We have been using Asana for the last 2 years and it has become a central part of the functionality of our business. Without it we would have issues keeping up with all the different project demands and needs for our clients. We've spent a lot of time tweaking custom fields and dependent tasks to work just right for us and even use it for our product roadmaps. Plus most of our clients love that we have a simple easy to use system that they can look at to see what's going on. Asana for the win.,10/11/2016,Pros: New features released frequently. Like dependent tasks and custom fields,Cons: I wish I could hide certain tasks until it was time for them to be accomplished.
802,802 Asana,Asana,Charlie G.,Owner / Author,Management Consulting,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,8,"“""Nearly"" the perfect team collaboration tool”","Overall: My team and I have used too many apps to count and have found Asana to be the best for our purposes. Its integrations allow us to build functionality we need from our other apps and what was most telling is that some of our newer teammates that didn't see our older systems just fell into using it without much training or information. There's one critical feature that would push it into the 5 star range for us: the ability to set task start dates. The more you plan and bake future plans and tasks into Asana, the more cluttered your task list looks and the more micro-decisions you have to make to remember that certain tasks aren't ready to be started. ""Waiting For"" task was a great step, but we need this one - not having start dates actually creates a disincentive for us to get our future projects in Asana at present.",3/11/2016,,
803,803 Asana,Asana,Carolina P.,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,9,“Great management tool”,"Overall: Asana has been our tool of choice for some years, we started with the free version and later upgraded. We use it to track progress of everything that is done in our company, from development tasks to more operative tasks. We try to have everything we do as a task so we can later look for it when we don't remember if something has been done and by whom. It took us little time to learn how to use it but a bit more to take advantage of every feature. In general the app is intuitive and we have ways to do most of the things we need to do. Sometimes it can be a bit slow when moving too many tasks or copying them, but it's the only drawback we have found until now. With the recent addition of custom fields we have been able to customize our tasks even more and it makes tasks easier to classify and find.",3/11/2016,,
804,804 Asana,Asana,Ernest A.,Program Manager,Architecture & Planning,2+ years,4,4,4,,5,7,“ASANA / Software Review”,,17/8/2016,,"Cons: The notification setup could be improved so that you can customize what notification you receive or even incorporating a pop-up notification so, your email doesn't get bombarded with Asana notifications. In order, to notify an individual that a task is complete and they need to begin their portion of the task you have to send the notification as a subtask assigned directly to that person in order to confirm that they have reviewed the completed task."
805,805 Asana,Asana,Paul D.,Project Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Asana Review”,Overall:,6/10/2020,"Pros: As a project manager, you have to be able to organize the different accounts that you are working with and Asana does the job very well. I am able to organize the different accounts that I work with and assign different tasks to different people and departments. It made everything easier to organize the different task that you need.","Cons: The only improvement that I would like to include is being able to organize and move around tasks in a queue. It would be extremely useful for the departments that require more direction on which tasks to do first. You can change the due date, but you cannot rearrange on which task to do first."
806,806 Asana,Asana,Ariana F.,Designer UX,Utilities,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,9,“ asana in my daily life”,"Overall: I started using asana to manage my ecommerce creation design team and since then I have been having very good experiences, it is a very intuitive and quick to use app. I really liked the new goal functionality, I will definitely use it with my team.",23/9/2020,"Pros: Its interface is very intuitive and simple, but what I liked most about Asana, in a first impression, was its onboarding. It is wonderful ! This is because on your first access the app takes you to an active step by step in creating your first project. Help me so much in a First acess.","Cons: A single point against is with the integration of asana with google gmail. For me it doesn't make much sense to just open the option to create a tab when I open an email. I would like, in the integration, to be free to create a task in the asana whenever you want."
807,807 Asana,Asana,Ori B.,Senior Sponsorship Coordinator,Entertainment,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Absolutely phenomenal for all forms of project management and value tracking”,,20/7/2020,,Cons: The product itself is great. It's the user education and change management with coworkers that took the most time to overcome.
808,808 Asana,Asana,Alex K.,Marketing Operations Coordinator,Apparel & Fashion,2+ years,5,4,4,5,,9,“Great product for creative project management ”,"Overall: My experience with Asana has been great. There are so many neat tricks and functions to take advantage of and over all, we've increased visibility, productivity and communication within the creative and marketing teams at the company.",19/6/2020,"Pros: It's very easy to tailor Asana to your team's needs and workflow. Our old project management software was very restrictive in what it allowed users to do and the way in which we were able to organize information, assignments and tasks. We have a pretty unusual team structure and workflow, but Asana allows us to more easily keep things organized and integrated.","Cons: The only thing that I was Asana had was a system for intaking creative requests/briefs and easily turning them into tasks. Currently we use a separate software to have requesters write briefs and we simply copy and paste that request into an Asana task. It would be great if Asana had that functionality within the tool, but it's not a huge deal!"
809,809 Asana,Asana,Dominic C.,Quality Assurance,Computer Games,2+ years,5,5,4,,,9,“Great for keeping a work team organized ”,,8/6/2020,,Cons: I have noticed that some of their features can cause some confusion and could be improved upon.
810,810 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Education Management,2+ years,4,4,4,,,7,“Great if everyone uses it”,,29/4/2020,,"Cons: The downside to this program is that if one person on the team doesn't use it, it throws off the whole team. In order to be the most efficient, everyone needs to be using and updating the program regularly, or else there is no point. Unfortunately, we have some older team members who find it difficult to understand, and have just elected to stop trying to understand it."
811,811 Asana,Asana,Michael L.,Web Developer,Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing,2+ years,4,4,4,,,7,“Good Project Management Tool”,Overall: I'm a part of an in-house marketing team for my company and we have recently found the need for a good project management tool as our team has grown to track the progress of all the various projects we're doing and the workload of every member of the team to better allocate our resources. We decided on Asana and so far it has been a good experience. It does everything we need it. It also has a better designed interface than some of the other project management tools out there. It's easier to get acquainted with and understand all the features than some of the other available software options as well. The forms are very useful for automating some of tasks and the Portfolios are very helpful with understanding the flow of the project(s) as well as checking workload capacity for each member of the team. So far I've been happy with it. It's better than our old system.,30/3/2020,Pros: Easy to configure and understand. Good interface design makes it easy to see and distinguish what's happening in the tool. Forms makes automating mundane tasks more convenient. Portfolios help managers and team members see project timelines and workload capacity.,Cons: Not as robust as some of the other project management tools we tested. Not the best designed interface available but still good. Simplicity of the tool that helps in grasping and understanding it quickly decreases some functionality and customizability in other project management software tools.
812,812 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Government Relations,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“Asana”,,26/1/2020,,Cons: I have not had any issues with using Asana software. It meets the organizations needs for what we are utilizing it for.

There is definitely more functionality, even in the free version, that we have yet to maximize",5/12/2019,"Pros: Very easy to use - we use the free platform options and it has sufficed our team needs. Helps us stay on target for projects and keep all of our tasks in once place. And if the setting is turned on, you get unicorns flying across the screen encouraging you when you check stuff off","Cons: Some basic functionality stuff - doesn't alphabetize team projects for ease of finding; hard to sort subsections by due date, etc."
814,814 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Hospitality,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Ultimate Task-Keeper”,"Overall: Our overall experience with Asana has only been positive. It's helped set clear expectations for our employees, as well as keep everyone on task with project deadlines.",7/11/2019,"Pros: We use Asana to help set deadlines for projects and stay organized as a department, as well as organizationally. It makes it easy to delegate tasks to employees across various departments and collaborate on different projects.",Cons: I think one idea for extending scheduling capabilities for Asana would be to have an integration to people's email calendars (if they don't already have that in place) to send timely reminders for upcoming due dates.
815,815 Asana,Asana,Claudia C.,Senior Customer Strategist,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,4,,,10,"“Asanahhh, but its ok”","Overall: Lots to learn, its less easy than Basecamp- but they do provide a lot of tutorials",25/9/2019,"Pros: I like that there are animals that fly across the screen when you finish a task-- that's pretty cool, and creative.",Cons: I think there could be a more efficient way to create multiple/bulk tasks-- and maybe there is and I just don't know it yet.
816,816 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,4,4,4,,,9,“Project Management Simplified”,"Overall: Managing the workflow of projects with many factors and individuals has always been a daunting task, but Asana has solved this challenge. It isn't always easy keeping up with the many sides of projects while measuring the progress as well as speed, but dare I say it has even made project management fun.",25/9/2019,"Pros: Having to run projects mean that sometimes the littlest things may get overlooked, but with Asana we're able to create todo lists for people and teams so that at any point, everyone knows what needs to be done and at the right time. This has greatly improved both efficiency and effectiveness. Being able to track the progress of projects on a daily or weekly basis has proven to be very useful in managing the overall execution of projects.","Cons: The notifications should definitely be worked on. I like to get notified accurately about certain things, but the inbox can get a bit messy, which would lead to missing out on important details."
817,817 Asana,Asana,Clay S.,Director of Astonishment,Online Media,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Great Lightweight Project Manager”,,15/8/2019,,Cons: There are a few UI things that don't work perfectly with my workflow

819,819 Asana,Asana,Jason B.,Vice President of Analytics,Public Relations and Communications,2+ years,4,4,5,,4,9,“One of the best project management tools”,"Overall: Asana is an amazing tool that helps teams manage all types of tasks. While not the most sophisticated tool in the field, it is effective and efficient at what it was made to do. The learning curve may be a little higher than other platforms, but overall, it's well worth the time.",8/8/2019,Pros: A mobile app + third party integrations with a lot of popular platforms makes Asana an effective tool. It's flexible and the modern design makes Asana easy and almost fun to use. There is a free version that provides solid basic project management capabilities and the paid tiers allow you to choose the best level to ensure the platform is well worth your investment of money.,Cons: Not ideal for graphics-intensive work or incredibly sophisticated projects. Reporting is light but it works perfectly for 90% of projects that require workflow management.
820,820 Asana,Asana,John N.,Talent Acquisition/Recruiting Extraordinaire,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“A well organized tool for project collaboration and tracking. ”,Overall: It has made us capable to organize and synchronize our work with the remote teams allowing us to collaborate in a more easy way. It has provided lots of efficiency and a reliable ways to keep the track of the projects.,30/7/2019,Pros: The user-interface is very attractive and user-friendly. It makes easy for us to navigate through the application looking for the suitable resources and tasks. I can monitor the whole progress of the work and keeps the overall track of the activities with the help of this efficient tool.,"Cons: This product requires know how on management tools to use it easily , so for the beginners it is quite a complex tool. In order to gain the full productivitty out of it, on should know how to use it. The initial setup consumes a lot of time and affects the overall experience."
821,821 Asana,Asana,Gopinath V.,Senior Developer,Food & Beverages,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Make it Simple”,,30/7/2019,,"Cons: Less customizable, Missing some automated features."

823,823 Asana,Asana,Shilpa S.,Marketing Strategist,Internet,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,9,“Best project management tool”,Overall: I use Asana to pass my email designs to the campaign operations team so that they can finally get it out to the customers. The team lead would then assign the task to the member of his team who would be available. The comment added by any member would then be notified to every follower of the task. This helped in finishing the task sooner because anyone reading the comment would get back immediately reducing the time for any blockers.,23/5/2019,"Pros: The capability to build projects and add members who are relevant to the project. It was pretty easy to get any new member to sign up to the tool as well. Adding followers is seamless. Every time someone commented on the task, I would get an email notification in my inbox and take actions immediately.",Cons: The limit of adding members to a specific project. I wish it had a higher upper cap.

I even introduced it to few of my friends as a easy task managemnet options,25/4/2019,Pros: Asana is easy to understand with great teaching videos. I appreciate that everything that is done within the task itself is logged. Quick support always helped with any questions I had and in 5 years of usage only 1 very minor outage of service with great mobile app,"Cons: I would like few more options and tweaks for my task, such as hidden notes, or options to change order of task, but as Asana is progressing forward I can see a lot of little features like this actually happening"
825,825 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,5,,,10,“Fantastic and Easy to Use”,"Overall: Asana allowed my company to organize our tasks, milestone plan, and appropriately track status at an incredible value.",20/4/2019,"Pros: What I enjoy most about Asana is the value. Working for a small company, cost is always a concern and the features that Asana makes available to the free tier is very welcoming. It allowed us to fully kick the tires on the product before before eventually paying for services. Additionally, Asana's integration with third party services is very welcoming. We leverage a popular time tracking software that seamlessly integrated with Asana making our lives easier.","Cons: While it has improved over time, handling of subtasks and tags is a little awkward. With respect to tags, it would be nice to apply them easier and possibly sort tasks based on them. With respect to subtasks, overall use seems awkward. It would be nice if it were easier to edit tasks without drilling down into it. It would also be nice to have an ordering to subtasks."
826,826 Asana,Asana,Kamna K.,Business Strategy Manager,Consumer Electronics,2+ years,4,4,4,,5,10,“The ultimate tool to manage and plan tasks”,"Overall: Love using Asana. It's great how you get spammed by email if you have overdue tasks or tasks due soon. Not only helps with team productivity but also boosts self management amongst the team and sense of responsibility to take deadlines and timelines very seriously. Highly recommended for companies with predictable recurring marketing or other operations as well as for brainstorming ideas and sharing, ideating amongst teams.",19/4/2019,"Pros: It's just a very nifty tool for small teams to use. Creating recurring tasks, their timeline feature and power ups are all nice add-ons on the paid plan. It's also good to use on the free plan for really small teams.","Cons: Their Slack power up is super annoying. You can't choose what notifications you want passed to Slack from Asana. By default, it's everything. Asana should take cues from Trello and fix this."
827,827 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,4,,,9,“Project Management Tools”,Overall: Really great experience with Asana .,17/4/2019,"Pros: 1. Asana is great if you are working virtually and you have a virtual team. 2. Define all your tasks on Asana with proper description , so your team could understand the things properly. 3. Get full update of all your tasks by your developers. 4. You can define milestone as per your amount of tasks. 5. You can add credentials of any resource like Server credentials or account credentials on Asana , so your team can use in order to achieve the tasks.",Cons: You should know little about project management tools in order to use Asana.
828,828 Asana,Asana,Patti P.,CEO,Pharmaceuticals,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,"“Keeps My Ducks in a Row, and My Sanity Intact!”",Overall: Prioritizing projects and people to get tasks done by reducing emails,10/4/2019,"Pros: I love this program. It is so easy to use, and it is fabulous to help organize team members within a single company and across companies or contractors. It sends reminders of tasks, allows one to upload documents/links, send messages, and to organize and prioritize tasks/subtasks and projects.","Cons: There's not much I don't like. If I had to pick one thing, I have trouble adding tasks within a project, because how to do it is not totally obvious to me. I figure it out, but not before i make a mistake each time."
829,829 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Simple and Great for Team Timelines”,"Overall: This software was already being used by my team when I was hired. I was originally frustrated about being required to use it to check off my tast progress. However, once I saw the benefits of the entire team collaborating and staying synced up on projects I can really appreciate the benefits of our team using this software and have come rely on it and enjoy using it.",5/4/2019,Pros: This software allows my entire team to stay in sync with our team deadlines. When we are writing content for different areas it's extremely helpful to see when each person will have their project completed and to see when projects are officially check off.,"Cons: When setting deadlines you sometimes what to re scroll back to the bottom of your task list and this can become tedious. However, this only occurs onece a month when setting up initial deadlines."
830,830 Asana,Asana,Zackery H.,EDI Project Manager,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,5,3,4,,,10,“Rough Start but Smooth Running”,Overall: It's unparalleled when you get the hang of using it and have a clear idea of what you want to do but it takes a little time and training for it to show it's true potential.,3/4/2019,Pros: Very useful for tracking large projects and task interdependencies. You can invite customers to view the project progress and attach needed files directly to tasks. This helps cut down on status update emails and for the customer to remain in the loop of needed items and task deadlines. The timeline view is extremely useful in seeing how everything connects and how long the project will take. Templates are very useful if you commonly take on similar projects.,Cons: The calendar is a bit useless when you have multiple items running at the same time. Whoever is configuring the project in Asana will need to know about project management and some familiarity with Asana to ensure it doesn't become a jumbled mess of tasks. Some features are missing or hidden that would be really useful such as the ability to use a project template and shift the deadlines to start at the current date or move multiple tasks to be subtasks in one action.
831,831 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Medical Devices,2+ years,5,4,5,,,10,“A great way to keep group tasks organized!”,"Overall: We use Asana to escalate support issues to our development team, this helps keep teams that don't normally work together organized and on track to complete the goal.",2/4/2019,"Pros: Asana provides the ability to collaborate and keep track of progress on given tasks. Through the use of teams, you can organize tasks and assign responsible parties. As minor of a feature as it is, Themes help personalize the product. The winter theme with the falling snow adds a touch of fun to the work day",Cons: There may be a slight learning curve as with anything upon your first use but overall I do not have much negative to say about this product.

The user interface makes it really easy to learn how to use and it's integration with gmail and it's Chrome extension add to its utility.,"Cons: The free version of Asana that we've used is fairly limited when it comes to personalization. I understand that Asana needs to entice users to upgrade to paid access, but I think they should offer more options to give a better sense of the product for those interested in using at a larger scale professionally."

A little more lengthy & loses the context of your comment being an annotation of an image."
834,834 Asana,Asana,Jordan D.,Marketing Analytics Specialist,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Team GTD for the Future of Work”,,11/3/2019,,Cons: I wish there was a clearer separation between personal tasks and corporated to-dos. I currently use Todoist for all my personal task management (mostly for non-work projects).

I love how easy it is to create different project boards that are easy to understand and help to clean up the work flow.,Cons: I wish there was a better way to get desktop notifications when tasks are added or updated instead of just the email notifications. They tend to mess up my inbox - wish it could just be a notification while i'm working!
836,836 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Best Task Manager Out There”,,9/1/2019,,Cons: Some of the advanced features are hidden or are confusing to set up. I wish they offered more notification features. Right now it's pretty much an all or nothing. The reporting could be a little more robust.
837,837 Asana,Asana,Laura H.,Owner,Retail,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Efficiency is Key!”,,3/1/2019,,"Cons: When you assign more than one person to a task, both people need to delete it from their lists. I wish that if one person did the task and deleted it, it would automatically delete it from the other person's list. The way it is now, we have occasionally had someone working on a task they were co-assigned that was already completed by the other assignee."
838,838 Asana,Asana,Richard D.,IT,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Can help keep you organized”,"Overall: Getting teams to use it is like breaking a mule. Once over the hurdle, it easily becomes commonplace.",27/12/2018,Pros: It provides a simple method to keeping track of daily/weekly tasks.,"Cons: It is an open-floor concept. There are no ""walls"" out of the box so its too simple for a team within a company to use it to their own interpretation. Teams can easily become confused or lost when collaborating in another team's environment, just based on usage differences. It allows for anyone in the company to instantly become your boss by simply assigning you a task and a due date, reprioritizing your entire workload without merit."
839,839 Asana,Asana,Jason P.,Executive Manager,Retail,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,9,“An Excellent Time Saver”,Overall: Before I began to use Asana the job of assigning tasks was time consuming and confusing for me - not to mention changes updating my employees of changes in responsibility and due dates. Asana has simplified this task for me. Thank you Asana!,21/12/2018,Pros: The service has an interface which is not only easy to become familar with but also aesthetically pleasing. I enjoy the ability to be able to copy and paste my list of assignments from an Excel spreadsheet. This feature is a great time saver as it prevents me from having to spend time re-typing assignments in individual e-mails! The ability to easily change responsibilities and due dates also saves me a lot of time as before Asana I did this by e-mail. Now all it takes is a few clicks and my employees are notified by an e-mail from Asana. I also throughly enjoy Asana's feature of providing notifications to me via e-mail whenever tasks are completed. The notification function was very easy to customize to my desires so I did not receive unwanted e-mails.,Cons: There were very few if any aspects of Asana that I would change.
840,840 Asana,Asana,Danielle A.,Marketing Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,4,,,9,“Task Manager Must-Have”,"Overall: Asana has been a great tool to help us keep track of all of the moving pieces for each project. It also helps keep all of us on task, especially as remote employees.",14/12/2018,"Pros: I love how we can set up different projects within the system and manage all of the tasks for each one, without having to view all tasks for every project. I also like how you can sort tasks by completion, incompletion and due date.","Cons: I wish subtasks showed up in the calendar view of things and I'm not a fan of all of the email notifications sent, especially the ones when our project manager is assigning tasks, it floods my inbox."

It cuts down on wasted time as it is easy to see when projects are complete, eliminating the need for constant circling back to check in on progress.",Cons: It is difficult to complain as the desired functionality we would like to see is included in the paid version of the software and we currently use the free version. It would be nice to have additional privacy setting for specific projects that can be sensitive.

The system can be customized to work with any business type, project, or need. Though more limited, the free version is more than enough for a small business owner to use to stay organized and keep on track.","Cons: There are some inconveniences when it comes to merging and moving tasks, especially subtasks. Each subtask basically needs to be rewritten if you want to move it to another major task."

Asana is the place where you can prepare all of your ""tools"" before you go work.",16/10/2018,Pros: I love how this app is so simple and easy to use.

Because usually team leaders set project tasks and deadlines, but when it comes to implementation you can't see anyone. Justice is very important among colleagues. If one worker works and the rest of all just walks around then we can't talk about productivity. Thanks to Asana now in our company everyone knows their duties. When project manager sets tasks he can choose specific person for specific task and also his team members in this task. Asana reduced our company costs and provided friendly environment among team members. After Asana we achieved to spent less effort for projects and managed our time more efficiently. Now whenever there is a new project we feel excited to start. Because Asana made things done easier with collaboration.",Cons: Overall I am satisfied with Asana but there is one feature which will be great if added. Sometimes it is hard to type whenever there is a complicated issue. It would be easy to express your ideas with audio or video conferencing. Hope this feature will be added soon.
846,846 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,3,5,4,5,10,“The ultimate task and project management system”,,26/7/2018,,"Cons: In an effort to add all the features my colleagues have complained about it looking intimidating and not wanting to learn. Yet, they said the same thing about basecamp with has about half as many menus and buttons, but also lacks some functionality that Asana has. I really have very few negatives about Asana. Would love an offline application for Mac."

I love how I can work with multiple projects, at different companies and still have a global view of all my tasks. I also like asana's flexibility by not only have lists of tasks but also allowing me to do boards like Trello.","Cons: There are some limitations in terms of features, that sometimes do not allow me to organize and visualize my tasks the way I want them too. One of them is the way that they organize the section of ""My Tasks""."
848,848 Asana,Asana,Jazzy T.,Director,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,4,3,5,8,"“Beautiful interface but a little messy to use, good price”",Overall: A good project management tool for any size business.,27/6/2018,"Pros: App for mobile and desktop accessibility is easy to install and access. You can use a google account to register and sign in with that if you are a major google user, can keep things simple. It's easy to create teams and the free version will get a small business by. Files attached to projects are easy to access. The cost per month for the pro version is very affordable for the extra inclusions.",Cons: The layout is not as user friendly as it could be and its very sensitive to clicks to create new projects etc. The main page layout could include the inbox and my tasks on the same screen as there is a lot of going between pages to see all your info. The free version is good for a small business.

Also assigning tasks and reviewing who is at what stage of the project is helpful. I know there is a lot of project management software out there, I just found Asana is among the best as for user-friendliness and ability to adapt. Will highly recommend.","Cons: I'm not crazy about the app, of course, it can't be as complete as the desktop version, however, I just found it to be too clunky and I only use it at a workstation."

It provides a big picture perspective so I don't fall behind and I can easily check to see what the status is.,19/4/2018,Pros: I've been an Asana user for 4-5 years now and the software has come a long way. They are continuously adding new features. Their support site is really great to read up on shortcuts and new ways to organize your projects. The templates are nicely put together and I love the new status feature.,Cons: I wish two people could share a task instead of one being a follower. I think the emails that come in for task updates and confusing and I don't like the layout.
852,852 Asana,Asana,Sabrina H.,EA,Electrical/Electronic Manufacturing,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Best thing ever invented”,,5/4/2018,,Cons: Asana can be improved by adding a hierarchy or some sort of permission level setting. Not good if you are wanting to keep projects private as everyone is on the same permission level and can share and delete users at will.
853,853 Asana,Asana,Ashish A.,Software Engineer,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,9,“Simple and easy project or work management tool”,Overall: We are using asana in one of our transport tracking tool. The benefits we have realized are that We are now able to see complete track of product on a single page. Asana tracks all the activities happened to a task so there is a transparency of how did what and when with a task. Priorities of task can be managed by simple drag and drop up and down within a stage. I recommend Asana to software development team who wants to track all daily activities.,18/3/2018,Pros: Asana is suitable to every agile supported project. User interface is easy to handle. Task creation and sub-task creation can be done on a single UI. It is easy to move task from backlog to sprint and sprint to test. The stages can be easily customized by simply adding new stage. You can easily refer a person on comments or task description. Tasks can be easily moved moved to other stages by simple drag and drop. Calendar view is effective and shows overall picture of project.,Cons: I didn't find major cons in the tool. But it would be great If it could have supported time tracking. the only way to track time currently is to add a due date to a task. Sometimes it display an error on task deletion but later on task is deleted.
854,854 Asana,Asana,Kristen S.,Project Manager,51-200 employees,2+ years,4,4,5,4,5,10,“Great Collaboration Program! Highly Rated!”,Overall: Makes it easy to organize projects and assign tasks to a team,15/2/2018,Pros: Great software to plan a project! Can easily be used for both large and small projects. I highly recommend this program. The email reminders are an awesome feature that keeps us on track! Sharing notes is also another great feature that helps bring the field and office together.,Cons: The sub tasks are difficult to keep track of. Controlling the reminders is difficult and it was difficult to figure out how to mark tasks as done. Lastly I still cannot figure out how to move life stages without moving the entire project to the next phase.
855,855 Asana,Asana,Katherine F.,Head of Sales,Transportation/Trucking/Railroad,2+ years,4,4,5,4,4,9,"“Best thing, facility and easy platform with full fuctions Asana.”","Overall: I have benefited a lot from Asana in my work area, since in my company, it was previously very difficult to carry out projects and organize them in different folders, since we implemented Asana, everything has become easier.",15/2/2018,"Pros: The best thing about Asana is the way in which the projects are done, it is much easier to use than any other software specialized in projects, Asana what it implements and proposes in its platform is comfort and ease of work, and has achieved it in all this time, since it is very comfortable to use and very easy to implement.","Cons: I do not like the prices of Asana, it is worth saying that Asana is a very collaborative software that has very high-ranking functions, but I would like it to be cheaper software and with good accessibility with respect to its plans and prices stipule."
856,856 Asana,Asana,Liz Y.,Founder,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,4,5,,,“We use Asana to keep track of tasks over multiple projects”,"OverallPros: It's easy to add people (such as clients) to certain projects or teams, and is great for running through remaining tasks and responsibilities on a project when you're on a call with the client. You can also have subtasks, which many other project management software lacks. You can color-code projects within a team to make it easier to navigate or distinguish between project types (for example, one color for clients, one color for internal business things).",1/12/2017,,Cons: I wish you could have sub-projects within a project. You can break projects down into sections using a colon (which creates a header within the task list) but it would be nice if sub-projects were available.

I'd like to be able to add dependency function for less."

Asana was the one that I decided to give a try. Although there are shop management systems out there for the printing industry....the ones I have subscribed too, were either too hard to learn and teach staff to use efficiently or they were cost prohibitive. Asana offers a basic structure for me to be able to build a working shop production management system, that is fairly easy to teach and learn.","Cons: The cost for 10 seats as they call them was a bit expensive for the year, for a small business. However I think it is worth the money at this point and time. Especially if they continue to offer more updates and improvements to their platform. However, the most disappointing thing is that although now I have paid for and am using 10 positions on their program, I must buy another 5 seats on their program even though I may only need two of them for future expansion of employees that would be needing access to this system. It would be nice to see the option to add single positions, at a bit higher price than the 5 seats, that I would be required to buy now."

Licensed Official Catalonia Tourguide,Leisure,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Couldn't run my online business without it”,,26/4/2017,,"Cons: Calendar starts on Sunday and can't make it start on Monday, what sometimes causes date mistakes. The phone and tablet apps show the ""incomplete tasks"" view by default, which I find to be very cluttered: I'd like to be able to set it to the ""Tasks by Due Date"" by default, so I can focus on what I need to do today, rather than random incomplete tasks."

It's great because it really does lighten the load on email communication between marketers, project owners and production team members. Asana seems ready to introduce great new features to their software regularly and the mobile app is as functional as it is beautiful. The custom fields feature has been the biggest benefit to us recently, as it allows us to track items within the context of Scrum project management.",22/2/2017,"Pros: Limits emails, Great mobile application, Custom field navigation is brilliant, Support is above average.","Cons: Very text-based, which is a minor detriment to its overall great UI, Uptime and load times could be improved a little bit."
861,861 Asana,Asana,David R.,"Director, Interactive Strategy",Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,3,5,4,10,“Great Product- Time to build the community.”,"Overall: I've been using Asana for over a year in my current role, and was the lead building out the overall web dev process within Asana. I've also used Open Air, Trello, Basecamp and MS Project, and Asana has been the best executional tool, by far. I believe a few tools could help provide teams and PM's with more options, including a stronger Gantt chart tool or integration point, as well as making sub tasks easier to add to projects/calendar views. I personally would have preferred these elements over boards. Though I get boards are more for new users as opposed to current, strategically. The BIGGEST thing I would love to see is a community building effort from Asana. Plenty of communities for developers, not many for Project Managers / Project Owners / Team Leads.",6/12/2016,Pros: - Flexible - Great for scheduling - Harvest integration,Cons: - Poor Gantt chart integration (from my perspective) - Hard to get subtasks on scheduled - No project or task templating
862,862 Asana,Asana,Chais M.,Owner,Apparel & Fashion,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana is the backbone to our business”,"Overall: Asana is known as a project/task manager, but for us it's our business backbone! We recently upgraded to a Pro account, in order to take advantage of custom fields, and it has saved us SO MUCH hassle because of the new features. There are a bunch of project managers out there, but one of the big things we love about asana is how it integrates with tools like Zapier. I'm excited to have the new custom fields feature be part of the zapier integration system as well! :)",3/11/2016,Pros: it's easy to use and does 90% of what we need.,"Cons: No local backup (which could be a huge issue without internet) as we rely on it exclusively for customer jobs. Integration features are limited (no custom fields, no way to put a task in a specific header category automatically). The iOS apps and desktop web app are so different, the iOS features are very lacking."
863,863 Asana,Asana,Charlotte M.,Sr. Project Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“Great Product”,Overall: We use ASANA daily to keep track of everything from development tickets to meeting agenda items. I also use it to keep track of my personal to-do's. The ability to tag tasks is extremely helpful for when we want to link to all tasks pertaining to a particular subject. We find ASANA to be invaluable in our day-to-day business.,3/11/2016,Pros: Ease of use. Onboarding new employees takes no time at all. People are able to quickly understand and get up to speed with using ASANA.,Cons: I wish there was a way to easily log hours in each task and total them. I use the hack [3] in the task name but I cannot total hours included in subtasks.

No confusing functions, everything is simple and easy to use, and it's all straight forward. Productivity is key in our focus of work and being able to see all the information with a nice design, all key information is there. It's absolutely perfect for our cause, would definitely recommend.",3/11/2016,"Pros: It's easy to use, powerful and very straight forward all the key information you need to see is directly on the screen.","Cons: The only thing I have never really used is the left sidebar, just because this is slightly confusing I think with a few better styles and possibly make it suited more around the user would be a lot better."

My team is regularly working on projects together and I love being able to assign tasks to myself or others across the organization. You can easily see where each person is on each thing without having to ask them.,"Cons: Asana can sometimes only be as helpful as it's level of ""buy in"" company wide. I am sometimes limited when others in the organization do not use it, as it's main use (for me) is collaboration."
866,866 Asana,Asana,Cassandra W.,Global Events Marketing Manager,E-Learning,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Fantastic Project Management Tool - Once you get the hang of it.”,"Overall: LOVE Asana. I came from an organization that used JIRA in Marketing, and transferring over to Asana was life-changing.",10/10/2020,Pros: Love how CLEAR everything is. It's very easy to adapt to. The UI is beautiful and very intuitive. Really great when managing large events with many teams involved.,Cons: The e-mail alerts are a little bit much. It took us a while to figure out how to turn those off so everyone in a task didn't get notified.

I don't know what I'd do without it. I use it for some of my personal tasks too.,25/9/2020,Pros: I love the ability to keep track of each project and assign tasks to individual employees as well as have recurring tasks set up so it is much easier to manage and keep track of who is doing what.,Cons: Sometimes finding a task (or subtask) is a little tricky as is reading the notes for the tasks that are in depth.

The ability to divide a certain project into multiple sections and organise into various groups and categories is my best feature. In addition, this has the best UI among all other task management apps.","Cons: The free version of asana has limited options. For example, i need to pay for gantt/timeline view which would be nice if it was free. Also There's no option to archive a section once all tasks under them are completed."

A perfect software for task management. Really easy to assign tasks and track them",23/9/2020,Pros: Maybe the best software to manage your daily work. Really love how it is easy to switch between the list mode and the kanban mode. Another useful feature is the card that appears on the right when clicking on a specific task,"Cons: Right now it is possible to to assign a task to one collaborator only, while I would have liked to assign it to several collaborators. A shortcut to this could be the use of subtasks but you loose the general view."

I love also being able to color code everything.,"Cons: It takes a bit to get into the flow of using Asana as a product. Some stuff we found to be hard to use, but we chalked that up to inexperience with the product. I don't feel like it's too hard to understand after a couple of tries."
873,873 Asana,Asana,Jurran Y.,CEO,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,4,3,5,10,“Highly Recommended”,Overall:,7/7/2020,"Pros: I am a very visual planner and the UI is great for people who like to a have solid visual platform for their project management. I also love the templates and the app integration library, which also helps streamline my business processes.",Cons: The membership starts to get pricey when you go from 3 to 5 seats. Of course as a business owner I'm trying to save money! I also think that any paying customer should have the ability to brand their workspace. I use slack and they do not have a branding limitation on the plan that I have.

I have grown accustomed to it, but some coworkers struggle as they learn Asana for the first time."

The ability to store documents and communicate with other team members via the platform (through comments, etc.) is great for cutting down on unnecessary emails that clog up your inbox and makes files so much easier to locate.","Cons: The only thing about Asana that I've found I don't like is that the ""My Tasks"" section isn't as easily customized as other sections/projects are."

I keep them in this application and it provides many abilities for all types of industries with the checklist you can fully customize to keep track of the progress with an individual as well as make notes of any communications or special details you want to remember about them.,Cons: There isn't anything I dislike about this program since I can use it for free and it provides many features.

This task management tool is super great and I am happy because we are no longer using paper. We use Asana not only as a task management tool but also as a documentation tool,"Cons: Honestly speaking, there's no such thing as least important in Asana.

You can sort by due date, likes, and etc. but sometimes, I have so many tasks due on the same day I'd like to drag and drop to order them in by which ones I want to get done first (without having to set a time onto each task)."

I really like it a lot. The feedback from my team has been pretty great too. No major complaints so far.,3/12/2019,"Pros: I love how easy it is to use. You can create tasks really quickly and assign them to team members. You can also keep track of them to make sure that you arent falling behind on the timeline. The main thing to understand is that Asana's usefulness depends entirely on your entire team being on board with it. Even having 1-2 members not checking it regularly can throw everything off kilter. But once you get everyone on it, it makes things super efficient. It also works great even for small sized teams (which ours was). And lastly, email integration is pretty great. I never miss important notifications.",Cons: No major cons really. The only thing I can think of is that the pricing is probably a little high for mid sized teams.

I really dig the different views through which you can visualize a project and the automations too. The comment tool is tasks is also very good and effective.,"Cons: The search tool is a complete mess, I don't even know why I still waste my time trying to find things there. Wait, that's because it's better than looking throughout dozens of crammed tasks endlessly. The amount of information and stimuli in the screen is so big that it really wears me off to have to use it."

And from talking with the Copywriter, it's extremely easy for him to look at the tasks, know what needs to be done, prioritize his tasks, and move on to the next one.",5/10/2019,"Pros: I find Asana very easy to use. At my company, we use Asana mostly to assign tasks to our copyrighter and web designer. We have a separate column for each person, and can assign each task to anybody. Like I said in the title, Asana is very easy to use. I simply give it a title, open up the box to leave a description or details of what I need done, then assign it to the correct person. Then, when they've finished the task, I receive an email telling me it's done. The thing is, I'm guessing I'm not even using Asana to its full potential.","Cons: One thing that continues to catch me is when I'm finished typing in the information I need to leave for the person I'm typing out the task for, there's no ""enter"" or ""done"" or ""send"" button. I just have to click somewhere else on the page. I realize it's easy and not a big deal, but I'm used to having a button when I'm done typing, something to confirm that it was sent and not deleted. But that's the thing - it's not deleted. So maybe it's just more of a comfort-thing for me."
884,884 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Great for both a casual user and a project manager with experience”,"Overall: I really like Asana. I think the user interface is very pretty, it's pretty bug-free most times and if you want to get into more advanced features, Asana has them, but for the most part, most users will just use tasks, due dates, and that's all. I don't really like the subscription model, but we were able to secure a lower subscription rate either way as a non-profit through TechSoup",14/9/2019,"Pros: - ease of use, straightforward interface - low learning curve - great integrations with other applications (can make asana tasks in siri on my phone, or in slack) - business features make it easier for managers to check over task progress - options for lower pricepoint with non-profit organizations - great for small teams","Cons: - no way to add individuals to a team at prorated rate (if you have 5 users, and you want to add 1, you will have to pay for 10 users. the staircase model of payment is annoying for small teams with small budgets)"
885,885 Asana,Asana,Paul T.,IT Project Manager,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,9,“Asana use as a Project Manager for several years”,"Overall: Ideal to be used on the go and for larger international teams. due to the freemium model, usable for every size of team",19/8/2019,Pros: Simple and easy to use software. implementation is plug and play. creating new tasks or items is quite intuitive. Assignment of team colors is done in a jiffy,"Cons: Adding photos and video is a more expensive suite, but really worth it. Connector to AD is more difficult with MS Flow than with If this then that"
886,886 Asana,Asana,Andrea W.,IT Specialist,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,4,5,4,9,“Great for big project management.”,"Overall: Asana is best for sharing files with my clients. I can tag someone in the task and ask them for approval. Asana helps to delivery the projects of management, productivity, and teamwork. It allows me to present my weekly advance in a single report. Use to manage my tasks easily.",17/8/2019,"Pros: It is a server design to improve teamwork and interaction. It is used for list tracking, helps in project management. Easy to work with other employees. I had a great experience with this app. It is a well-balanced application. Gives track history of my projects. It keeps the order in preference.",Cons: Asana is slow to load big files and technical support. Some time projects are not easy to handle. It is a lightweight project management tool. Sometimes it is slow when I'm using it in offline mode.
887,887 Asana,Asana,Nishith K.,CEO,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,3,3,4,8,“Good for getting team focused”,,15/8/2019,,Cons: We still use Slack and wish some of the Slack features are available within Asana conversations.
888,888 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Translation and Localization,2+ years,4,5,4,,,7,“The best list based task management tool”,,22/7/2019,,Cons: Asana is not as flexible as competitive tools that allow you to display tasks in multiple formats. We found that this flexibility is important for different members of our team who work better in different ways.
889,889 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,3,,,7,“Asana - Honest Review”,Overall:,14/5/2019,Pros: I really loved the simplicity of the platform. Our team used it to task our recruiting coordinators to schedule interviews for our candidates. It was so easy to assign our coordinators task and see at a quick glance where everyone in my pipeline was standing. If I needed more information the coordinator usually wrote notes within each task of where the progress was currently at. I also loved that all the information lived with in the platform.,"Cons: Organizing all of my candidates were a bit of a pain. I work on multiple job posting at a time and it was a bit difficult creating sections to organize this effectively. I usually broke down each section by the stage candidates were at (waiting on candidate, scheduled, waiting on hiring manager)."
890,890 Asana,Asana,Justin H.,Instructional Designer,Higher Education,2+ years,4,3,5,,,7,“Asana for Project Management”,,5/5/2019,,"Cons: Asana can be a bit less intuitive than some products like basecamp, but for the complexity of the projects my office engages, it has been excellent. Only complaint would be some loss of user friendliness due to the robust nature of the program."
891,891 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Museums and Institutions,2+ years,5,5,4,,,9,“A fun and fluid project management tool for teams”,"Overall: I enjoy using Asana. It's vibrant and colorful, but does not distract or take away too much time from the actual project work.",17/4/2019,"Pros: Asana is very easy to use, but still offers some deep tools for tracking tasks and projects. It's a great asset for collaboration with team notifications and shared calendars. I also love how visually clean and smooth the system works online.","Cons: A nice mobile app version would be very helpful. There is also a flaw in the team calendar that does not allow you to easily print or export it, even though this is available for all of the other project calendars. Sometimes projects can still get lost. A clearer priority system might be good. There may be some features in the premium levels that offer more control for this."
892,892 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Publishing,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Kept us organized an on track with all projects”,Overall: I'd highly recommend this program to anyone seeking a project management tool. While I used it they continued to release product updates to add features I was looking for.,2/4/2019,"Pros: When I worked at a digital publisher we had a ton of brand partners, each with their own projects and deliverables. They all had a bunch of moving parts and different timelines so using this tool made sure we didn't drop the ball on any detail. Asana made it easy for us to stay organized as a team and held us each accountable for our piece of the puzzle. I'm pretty sure we never missed a deadline :)","Cons: At first it was a bit confusing to use but once I got the hang of all the different features, dashboards and views, it instantly made my life easier."
893,893 Asana,Asana,Brandon W.,Head of Content Marketing,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,8,“I Wouldn't Trade Asana for Anything”,"Overall: I wouldn't trade Asana for anything at this point. I've used the software for 3+ years, and it's been a great asset for our team.",30/3/2019,"Pros: The ability to duplicate tasks/projects is a huge time-saver because my work requires a lot of duplicate tasks and I use that feature every single day. The ability to tag parent tasks to boards helps with organization and I like that you can now ""edit"" any comments on tasks (before that was not an option).",Cons: I wish it would keep old tasks in an archive for a longer period in case we need to access them again (even though they have been completed.
894,894 Asana,Asana,ELDHOSE K.,CEO,Computer Software,2+ years,4,3,4,4,4,9,“An amazing agile project management tool”,"Overall: We are managing around 7 projects on Asana and its a great tool to do the same, we are really happy.",27/3/2019,"Pros: Asana is the best agile based project management framework out there in the market, we have been using Asana since 2017 and since then it is a part of us. We are running all our outsourcing projects on Asana. Client on boarding, ticketing etc. are done easily on Asana. It has a set of amazing features that helps us to manage the projects and resource effectively.","Cons: Please reduce the pricing plans if possible, its a bit high as compared to others."
895,895 Asana,Asana,Luiza K.,content planner,Retail,2+ years,5,5,4,5,,8,“Very good project management tool”,"Overall: Asana solved project management issues in our social media and content calendar. I started using Asana as a freelancer to manage my own projects, and then implemented with my co-workers who worked remotely in the same projects as me. Asana really helps everyone to keep track of project status, manage tasks, share files, etc..",21/3/2019,"Pros: I really liked using Asana for project management. It allows different people from the same team to work together, collaborate and keep track of project status. Their feature for sharing files makes it very easy. We used to use Asana for our content marketing planning and it worked very smoothly for a all remote team.","Cons: I really like Asana's interface. I feel it's even better and easier to use than Monday, another project management tool."
896,896 Asana,Asana,Alli H.,Agency Owner,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Asana is the freelancer's best friend”,"Overall: As a freelancer, I have a project list a mile long for multiple clients. I use Asana to keep track of project notes and due dates so details don't fall through the cracks. One of my clients recommended it to me so we can collaborate, and now I use it for my entire freelance business. I love having the app on my iPhone so I can see things at a glance and communicate with clients if necessary - so much easier than spreadsheets and email",13/3/2019,"Pros: Easy to use, inexpensive, mobile capabilities, email updates",Cons: Toggling between workspaces - I have different workspaces for different clients and haven't figured out how to get a bird's eye view of all my stuff.
897,897 Asana,Asana,Luis S.,Product Manager,Sporting Goods,2+ years,5,4,4,,4,8,"“Asana, a great project management tool for personal or company use”","Overall: Great! We started using the software about 2 years ago and the entire company loves it. Personally, it has helped me organize all of my projects since I am a product manager. They even added a timeline feature",20/2/2019,Pros: Asana is a grat software for anyone that needs to keep track of their projects. Everything from creating task to sub task can be done on this software. Create projects and invite anyone from your network to view and access your project.,Cons: What I like least is that Asana does not provide desktop notifications. I have to integrate with Slack and my email in order to recieve those notifications.
898,898 Asana,Asana,Ariel L.,Marketing Specialist,Accounting,2+ years,4,3,3,3,3,8,“Great product for project management tool”,Overall:,14/2/2019,"Pros: What I like most about this software is that its accessable through all platforms, PC, mobile, tablet, etc. This software also allows us to create ""virtual teams"" which help us collaborate on projects, and provides us with a notification of which step of the project is completed and which needs to be done.","Cons: What i don't like about this software is that it is not very intuitive. It takes a bit of time to get used to and it's more of a ""learn as you go"" type of project management tool. Setting up which notifications you receive and which you don't can be a hassle to set up correctly."
899,899 Asana,Asana,Melissa D.,Founder + Creative Director,Design,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,"“Asana is robust, flexible and great for teams”",,13/2/2019,,"Cons: It can tend to look visually uninspiring when your workspace is filled with lists of things to do. Those who get overwhelmed with long lists may glaze over and just see a wall of text in front of them and be stuck not taking any action at all. It may be in your interest to show team members a ""filled out project"" before you start, so that you are able to empower people to take action and not be stuck and overwhelmed by a long list of items to do."
900,900 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Philanthropy,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“Asana is the productivity tool I was looking for”,,1/2/2019,,"Cons: While Asana seems to be constantly updating what they're offering, I feel like I find small quirks from time to time. For example: If I create a template and pre-assign my team members roles within that template, they show up in My Tasks for each user. It seems like template documents shouldn't show up there. I think the real problem is that because Asana is SO versatile, it can't cater to specific needs like this one."
901,901 Asana,Asana,Wendy R.,Accountant III / Business Intelligence Analyst,Higher Education,2+ years,4,4,4,,5,8,“Used for small community theater group”,"Overall: I found Asana to be very useful in keeping track of all the tasks I had to do with our community theater productions. I was not successful in getting the rest of my group to participate much even though I trained them. They had a mental block thinking they weren't technical enough, or didn't want to learn something new I think.",25/1/2019,Pros: I liked being able to have to do lists that could be shared and seen by the entire group. I liked having a place to record tasks for each production that our community theater group did to have a template for the next show and not forget tasks that needed to be done. I liked the way to have a place for centralized communication that made it easy to follow comments from multiple people. Free for limited usage and small groups like we were.,"Cons: Copying one production to a new production was a little cumbersome - at least I could not figure out a super easy way. I would have like to have been able to have the due dates linked to a certain date, so that due dates of certain tasks could based on a certain time frame compared to a target date. If this functionality was available for the free accounts, I was unaware of it."
902,902 Asana,Asana,Monica C.,Artist,Arts and Crafts,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Ideal for creatives”,,18/1/2019,,"Cons: There is no option to save completed or cancelled tasks and they remain in one of the sections. I resort to creating sections titled ""Completed"" and ""Cancelled"" and dragging the board to the appropraite one. Even with canceled tasks, I like to keep track of all the details but there should be a feature that hides boards without losing all the infromation."
903,903 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“It'll make you want to be productive”,Overall: Asana is one of my favorite tools and is on my home screen on my phone. I recommend it over any task/project management tool.,21/12/2018,Pros: The style in the app is great. I love software that I actually enjoy using. It's clean and useful. The collaboration is great and keeps everyone on the same page. Greatly reduces the risk of people forgetting what to do or not knowing when they need to have it done.,Cons: Sometimes it difficult to decide when to use comments or when to Slack. I usually find my team just slacking for conversations but Asana is great for tracking tasks and projects.

905,905 Asana,Asana,Robert B.,Digital Marketing Coordinator,Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana: The only tool for me”,"Overall: Our department and I live almost exclusively out of Asana these days, it keeps us all on the same page. Wouldn't have it any other way.",22/10/2018,"Pros: I love that the software is super easy to use. You can drag tasks up and down your priority list. You can create different sections to easily sort tasks and stay organized. The best part is it replaces emails since you can communicate right within each task, making it easy to keep all communication and information in the same spot.","Cons: I'm a visual guy. A way to add colors to tasks and text to better sort tasks is all I can think of for ""cons."""
906,906 Asana,Asana,Tara H.,Marketing Coordinator & Corporate Social Responsibility Officer,Retail,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“There really isn't anything better!”,"Overall: Asana is the best project management software I have ever used for my marketing teams. I've tried Trello, Basecamp, among others. Hands down the best",19/10/2018,Pros: I've used Asana for over five years now at multiple organizations. It is the most intuitive and easy to use piece of project management software that I have every used. Best feature? Extra Delight by far. It's the little things.,Cons: There is so much additional functionality that comes with paid membership that you can't grasp it all at one time. So there is a bit of a learning curve. But they have great videos to help get you there.
907,907 Asana,Asana,Teresa K.,Co Founder,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,“Easiest App for Project Managemtn”,Overall: Another feature I love is the huge number of integrations available. I use Slack every day and I very much like the Slack integration.,15/8/2018,"Pros: This app is so easy to use! Everyone I've suggested it to comments on just that - they love the choice of boards or lists, and how easy it is to set up sub-tasks. If you have lots of tasks each day, and need a place to track them all, try Asana.","Cons: The pricing is a little high for a business that needs teams - but I am a bootstrapper. If you have an established business and Asana's pricing fits within your budget, you will love it."
908,908 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Furniture,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“Staying Organized”,"Overall: I have been using Asana for every aspect of project management for the last year. It is easy to store important documents, manage projects, deadlines and to do lists.",10/8/2018,Pros: I LOVE having a perfect tool for my digital to do list. I keep all of my ongoing projects in Asana and It keeps me organized. I love the ability to give myself project due dates to keep myself accoutable. I also enjoy the variety of templates that are available to help with project organization.,"Cons: I feel like some things can be a little hard to learn. I love using asana, but there are some aspects that have taken me a while to get used to - such as assigning tasks to more than one person (a team) and using boards instead of lists. Once you get over the learning curve it is all positive."

It feels a little separate from other teammates."
910,910 Asana,Asana,Stephanie M.,Photographer,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,5,4,3,8,“I like it because remains me what's next on my schedule”,"Overall: makes me more organise on my daily bases, keeps me on track with my meeting and also keeps my team workflow under control. each team member haver its own task and everyone knows what to accomplish in a day, I can sent task to everybody, no need to wast time in a email on text message.",10/7/2018,"Pros: is super friendly, and keeps under control my appointments and workflow, the calendar shows when I am busy to the other team members and also send me push notifications when I'm not on my computer.","Cons: is to much in a window, needs to reduce the quantity of clicks, if i need to teach someone how to use it is not easy for the newby employee."
911,911 Asana,Asana,James B.,Director,Human Resources,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Stay Organised And Keep Your Team Up To Date”,Overall: Just helped me to streamline my business and stay on top of things.,10/7/2018,Pros: The thing I like most about this software is the ability to keep track of how projects are progressing and what whos doing what. I've tried so many task management software and Asana is the standard upon which all other task management platforms are measured by.,Cons: What I like least about the software is that to move from the free version up to the paid version to unlock all the additional features you need to have a min of 5 paid team members. It would be great for smaller freelancers.
912,912 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,11-50 employees,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,10,“I have found Asana to be a wonderful tool to track projects for clients with ease. ”,Overall: Easy to organize and visualize the various projects I have and when they are due to help make my life simpler.,8/7/2018,Pros: Asana allows you to tailor your projects according to teams and clients. Which is insanely helpful when it comes to organizing what needs to get done. Your dash board + the progress of team mates are easy to track using task assignments and due dates. Overall - its the best software I have found that is functional and plays well with other applications such as harvest and slack.,Cons: The software does require some education when it comes to how to set projects and teams up correctly. It is not always inherent to the user (ie. clients) on how to utilize the software to make sure you receive the notification with their request.
913,913 Asana,Asana,Jason A.,Business Advisor & 90 Day Year Master Certified Partner Coach,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,10,“After years of searching this is the best and most flexible project management tool in existence”,"Overall: It our company's digital brain. Only recently have we added AirTable as a companion, but for many years we managed everything from our CRM to our Content Calendar to internal and external projects and launches.",6/6/2018,"Pros: The amount of features you get for ""free"" is unparalleled. The ability to add non-domain team members and clients is a great boast as well","Cons: While you can remove a non-domain person from a task or project, unless you upgrade you cannot remove them from the workspace. They won't get any notifications or see anything, so it is secure, but it is a nuisance that they still populate in search and quick fill functions."
914,914 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“I use Asana daily as a task manager for a psychologist's private practice. I improve systems.”,"Overall: Asana has helped me take my ideas about running a small office efficiently, and turn them into a reality.",13/5/2018,"Pros: This software is powerful. There are still features about Asana that I want to explore, but which I know could help me in my usage. I like how flexible it is, and how much information can be stored inside of it. For instance, I re-vamped the way that my workplace was using Asana, by storing all relevant standard operating procedures (SOPs) *within* task descriptions. That way, when someone asks a ""how do I"" question, or if we hire a new person, the needed information is already there. It's worth the money to be able to duplicate templates that contain information like that within the tasks.","Cons: Some of Asana's features are messy to use, so I go around them (e.g. the ""Today,"" ""Upcoming,"" sections of My Tasks). The problem: tasks that are assigned to me, and which I set for as ""due today,"" unfortunately don't automatically appear in the ""Today"" section of My Tasks. That doesn't work for me, because moving there is an extra step that becomes inefficient when I'm managing hundreds of tasks. I use a work-around of creating a special project for each day, and then I add ""due today"" tasks into that day's project."
915,915 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Real Estate,2+ years,4,5,4,5,,,“Easy to Use but lacks some traditional PM features”,,18/4/2018,,Cons: Some of the hierarchy features that traditional project management tools have are lacking for Asana. They do allow you to track sub-tasks but it's not as straight forward to roll them up into sprints and/or larger projects.
916,916 Asana,Asana,Hugo F.,Sales & Marketing Coordinator,Unspecified,2+ years,4,5,3,4,4,7,“Asana helps me stay very organized and on top of deadlines”,Overall: Extreme sense of organization and urgency.,27/3/2018,Pros: I really like that it feels like Asana stays on top of me with projects and deadlines with reminders when things are coming up or past due. The green text when items are due tomorrow or today give me a sense of urgency or allow me to re prioritize things if I won't be able to get to those items.,"Cons: I don't like that I'm not able to see the hierarchy in reports for sub-tasks. If I have a sub tasks, for example, and I run the report, they appear in two separate lines and it's hard to see that connection what sub-tasks go with the main tasks. I haven't ran that report in a while so I'm not sure if this has changed or if there are reports available to show me the information the way I want it."
917,917 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Higher Education,2+ years,5,3,4,4,4,8,“Asana is a super-charged project management tool”,,19/3/2018,,"Cons: There is some difficulty when you want to scale Asana to handle the all the tasks for a mid-sized to a larger organization. The tasks are lost in the huge pile of already pending task and you start missing the powerful organizing features of JIRA, etc."
918,918 Asana,Asana,Jason H.,Manager of Academic Enterprise Systems,Higher Education,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,,"“Asana is probably the best tool for managing personal projects, & one of the best for team projects.”",,15/3/2018,,"Cons: I wish there were more template options for the free plan. Currently there are only two options for users on the free plan. Asana could give free users the option to each template once. Then if the user wanted to use a premium template a second time, they should be prompted to upgrade to the paid plan."
919,919 Asana,Asana,Brittany H.,Web Coordinator,Higher Education,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“This has transformed our team”,"Overall: Our team is much more efficient, and it feels as close to effortless to collaborate as you can get. I'm getting more done faster and with higher quality.",7/3/2018,"Pros: My entire team can manage multiple complex projects at the same time, discuss them, gather associated resources and share them, and meet deadlines so much more easily now. We had been using Trello for a while, but making the switch to Asana felt more like a collaborative and task-focused environment, and that makes all the difference when you're trying to work on complex projects with large teams.",Cons: The inbox system is a mess. It can be overwhelming. You get notifications and messages there. I'd rather see the notifications and messages separated so that I can respond to messages more quickly.
920,920 Asana,Asana,Damian L.,IT Professional,Unspecified,2+ years,4,5,4,3,4,8,“Simple and easy to use project management application which helps managing the progress.”,"Overall: If you often have to collaborate with others on projects (especially if, like me, you and your team members all work remotely), this software is a great tool that will save you so much time and energy, and allow you to avoid dreaded email threads",23/1/2018,Pros: Asana interface is great to work with. Easy to add projects and tasks. It has a complete visibility on the tasks details and the task logs. Helps with project status.,"Cons: It's not quite as flexible as I'd like it to be, but we are able to make it work. I wish you could see sub-tasks displayed in the project's task list, and wish there were more options for how to display your tasks in the ""My Tasks"" list. It would also be nice to be able to create project templates, but we kind of have to rig that right now by creating dummy projects."
921,921 Asana,Asana,Dustin D.,Information Technology Administrator,Research,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Wonderful tool those wanting to track projects simply”,Overall: Great tool for collaborating in small to mid size groups on everyday projects and tasks.,19/1/2018,Pros: EXTREMELY easy to use. Has great features that are able to be used and understood by non-technical staff quickly. It is much more efficient for me to train staff how to use this rather than a more complicated PM tool. Set up is quick so you can start up your team and get working in just a few minutes.,Cons: I haven't found any major cons. It meets exactly what our needs are. However if you are looking for a tool with costing this isn't the tool for you. Functionality of dependencies of tasks within projects could use some work. We haven't used it for extremely complex projects so dependencies may be more of an issue in those scenarios.

You will need some time (and maybe a little assistance) to know everything about the app... but that is not bad, it means that it is an extensive and complex app",18/1/2018,"Pros: Lets you organize and keep track of projects, tasks, teams and individuals, with all the details associated with that... Lets you add deadlines, comments, upload documents, add repetitive task, link tasks between proyects, add a single task to different projects, link to other apps such as Slack for example, well the list of features is quite long",

925,925 Asana,Asana,ian p.,Director,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,5,5,4,5,8,“Excellent project management tool for teams with complex tasks and multiple projects”,Overall: It helps our teams manage projects successfully.,15/8/2017,"Pros: Asana is built on the principle of having one owner for every task, which means there is no ambiguity about who is responsible for what. It's a simple concept that helps users work on complex projects together, knowing that their team mates are completing other parts of the puzzle.","Cons: It's easy to get lost in the detail with Asana, and create lots of work that's more about managing the project than doing the work. It needs a champion in every team to help team members get on board with the Asana way of running projects."

You can create as many projects as you want, but it can be hard to sort through the most essential work for you to get done in one day across different projects."
927,927 Asana,Asana,Daniel F.,Engineer/Drafter,Construction,2+ years,4,4,3,4,4,8,“Asana a useful tool”,Overall: Asana has been a very useful tool. Before Asana I would spend time each day informing my supervisor what I had to work on and how long it would take me. With Asana my supervisor can see what I have to work and keep my work load populated so I don't have to have time waiting for the next assignment. Less down time and more productivity. Asana also helps me keep track of the tasks within an assignment so I don't forget to update something. Our company has been utilizing Asana for a little over a year now and with the continuing updates from Asana we have been able to streamline some of our processes and increase our productiveness. we look forward to what the next updates will bring and how we can adjust how we use Asana to become even more productive.,6/12/2016,Pros: The communication it provides between team members.,"Cons: Deleting tasks can be challenging sometime, especially if it is a nested task."
928,928 Asana,Asana,Charlotte B.,Content Marketing and Communications Manager,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,9,“Great Project Management Software”,"Overall: Our team was using Producteev, but the product was wonky, especially after it was acquired. It seemed like the company simply stopped updating the product, as if they were sunsetting it. Furthermore, Producteev was just clunky. Fortunately, someone joined our team who has used asana before, and she spoke very highly of it. We switched systems, and it's been great. Asana is much easier to use, allows for a lot of customization, and lets you get as granular as you'd like. I also like that Asana infuses its brand's personality into the app. Here is my wishlist: Adding a hack so that subtasks appear on the calendar view. Enhancing the product so it provides content and social media management capabilities. Enabling multiple assignees or a team for a task.",3/11/2016,"Pros: The cat hack, and the product's ease of use.",Cons: Would like greater management functionality. An integration with Buffer would be rad.
929,929 Asana,Asana,Dave P.,Associate Director,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,9,“Fantastic Task Management”,"Overall: For internal projects, when trying to corral small teams or large, there is nothing as streamlined and collaborative as Asana. The success staff is great, the software is great and continues to improve. I have brought Asana to two companies and will continue to do so into the future.",3/11/2016,"Pros: Collaboration features, simplicity, all-in-one view","Cons: There are certain advanced PM features that haven't made it to the top of the product roadmap yet. Would love to see advanced time resourcing, time tracking, and Gantt built right in."
930,930 Asana,Asana,Marc H.,Director of Marketing,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,,4,,,"“A Great, Free Project Management Software With Powerful Tools”","Overall: I work for a digital marketing agency and we've been using Asana now for over 2 years to manage internal tasks and projects for different client campaigns. During that time, the platform has gotten better and better while still staying free and easy to use which is not an easy task for any platform during that kind of timeframe.",1/12/2015,"Pros: Visually appealing and easy to navigate. The platform is set up to move from left to right with projects moving to task lists moving to descriptions and steps within them. Notes, comments and attachment features make it easy to keep everything a project needs in one place while a growing list of integrations means that we can connect the different tools we use during out projects all in one place.","Cons: With so many different functions and projects, the platform can get a little bulky, making it hard to find specific projects or tasks after a certain point. With that said, there are new search functionalities and filtering items that help with this, but it's still not perfected."
931,931 Asana,Asana,Alex B.,Senior Salesforce Administrator,Computer & Network Security,2+ years,4,5,4,,5,10,“The easiest project management tool.”,"Overall: When JIRA was too complex for our team's needs, we migrated to Asana. Eventually we were forced to consolidate applications and JIRA was made the company standard. Going back to JIRA was painful.",30/9/2020,"Pros: Asana has a very modern, simple, straightforward, intuitive, easy-to-use interface, especially in comparison to tools like JIRA. I find it's way easier to get user adoption with Asana, it's easier to understand what needs to be worked on and what's being worked on, and it provides all of the abilities I need for project management for a software team.","Cons: Nothing. Project management is not my favorite thing to do, and Asana makes it digestible."
932,932 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Painless Task Management”,Overall:,15/9/2020,"Pros: Asana is definitely the go-to task manager for our church tasks and project management! Its extremely easy to setup and use. Overall it's very functional, not buggy like other options we've tried and the interface is super user-friendly.",Cons: It would be great if Asana had more pricing options available for non-profit organizations. One other thing to consider may be making just a few of the project views available to free users.
933,933 Asana,Asana,Mary K.,Admin Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,8,“A must have for tasks”,"Overall: I use Asana daily to keep track of all to do tasks - recurring or once off, and the date they're due by.",11/8/2020,Pros: This is a must have for keeping track of tasks. Great thing is you can view your tasks as a list or on the calendar. Teams can be colour coded to make it easy to see what the task belongs to.,Cons: So far Asana has been doing everything I've needed and is easy to navigate so no problems on that front.
934,934 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,2,,,5,“Un buon prodotto per iniziare”,,29/7/2020,,"Cons: La versione gratuita ha molte limitazioni come funzinalità, e non si possono gestire team estesi. Le versioni a pagamento hanno costi per utente molto alti."
935,935 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Human Resources,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,9,“A Great Resource To Help Manage Your Time and Team ”,Overall:,24/6/2020,Pros: I loved how easy it was to get up and running with Asana. A lot of these kinds of software require hours of training. Not the case with Asana. I've used the free and paid versions and I was planning out my day and my projects within the first few minutes.,Cons: I wish it was a little easier to edit subtasks. Sometimes it can be a chore to edit these subtasks especially if you're not the admin of the task.
936,936 Asana,Asana,Samantha J.,Development Specialist,Civic & Social Organization,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana is amazing!”,Overall: I would recommend Asana to anyone who likes to be organized! The team at Asana is amazing. I love the company culture and what it stands for! I could not live without Asana,20/6/2020,Pros: Asana is easy to use and integrates with all of tools that I use daily. As a nonprofit we use Asana to organize all of our fundraising campaigns and it provides transparency among our whole team,"Cons: I think Asana is easy, but my Executive Director is vision impaired and has had some difficulty, even though Asana says the site is for visually impaired. However, Asana has been trying to work with her to overcome this barrier and was gracious in taking her feedback to improve."
937,937 Asana,Asana,Fallon L.,Freelance Video Editor / Production Coordinator,Media Production,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Great For Team Coordination”,"Overall: It's great. Very intuitive UI, very user friendly, and packed with all the features and tools you could want.",19/6/2020,"Pros: Asana is honestly the perfect software to use for film production on the indie-level. Being a production coordinator, I found this very useful to organizing and assigning tasks, benchmarking progress, and sharing information with your crew.","Cons: To be completely honest, there isn't much that I dislike about this software. I just wish it was used more in the industry!"
938,938 Asana,Asana,Katrina U.,owner,Design,2+ years,5,5,5,,4,10,“I love and use Asana every day. It is a pinned tab on my browser”,"Overall: My brain LOL...If it is not in Asana, it doesn't exist. I currently run my business growth, business operations, 20 fulfillment projects and my personal/family life from Asana.",19/6/2020,"Pros: I have tried numerous other platforms, but I keep coming back to Asana. It is just so feature-rich and user-friendly. I finally decided to just stop wasting time looking at other platforms (shiny objects) and focus on becoming the most effective user I can.",Cons: The only thing I would change is the upgrade price
939,939 Asana,Asana,Tori S.,Solutions Engineer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,5,,,8,“Asana Makes Organizing Tasks and Your Day So Easy ”,Overall: Very positive experience using Asana so far.,21/4/2020,"Pros: I've only been using Asana for a little less than a year, but I love that you can set priorities on tasks/asks. The way we use Asana is with a third-party vendor. We set up boards for different projects - one being asking questions. We have an entire board dedicated for questions my team has for the third party. We assign a priority and then wait for a response that will be visible to everyone. It's pretty awesome. We divide types of questions and if they are answered in swim lanes and the whole team finds it very useful. I also love that you can see who is online right now and you can set a status (sort of like Slack).","Cons: When I first started using Asana, it was a little confusing to me. Once you get used to it, it becomes intuitive and a great resource. There is one feature - the calendar- that shows tasks with due dates and such, but I wish I could merge my own calendar into it or sync it somehow so that my new tasks can align with things that are already going on."
940,940 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Most user-friendly project manager”,"Overall: For me, it's one of the most user-friendly and insightful project management apps I've tried. Haven't been using it for long, but will probably stick with it for a long time.",17/4/2020,"Pros: One of the most beautiful team and project management tools I've used. It might sound weird, but it means a lot :) If you're familiar with Trello, then you can consider Asana as a solid step up in terms of features and smoothness of performance. Cards creation is very fast and subsequent updating makes my works so much easier. Reporting is so  much nicer than most of the tools I've previously tried.","Cons: Asana is great overall. If I had to point one thing that I don't like is probably the formatting options and cards editor. Working with links and rich text is possible, but it's not as smooth as all other features of Asana. It's not a deal-breaker, but stands out among the the overall great software."
941,941 Asana,Asana,Luca S.,owner,Internet,2+ years,4,3,4,,,8,“The best saas for handle your project”,,11/3/2020,,"Cons: Sometimes the organization of the dasbohard is hard to figure out, yuo have to use it for weeks before understanding the basic feature. Should be more user friendly."
942,942 Asana,Asana,Paul S.,Media Director,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,4,4,3,,,9,“Keep your team running ”,,1/3/2020,,"Cons: Many improvements have been made in this area over the past few years, but not all attached file formats can be viewed in the app. Also being able to assign multiple team members to the same task would be a great feature for us."
943,943 Asana,Asana,John D.,Owner,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,4,4,5,9,“Good product no matter how you pronounce it”,Overall: Asana has helped me to be more organized and to stay on task.,15/2/2020,Pros: Asana is an easy to use tool to organize your projects whether you're working alone or with a team. I've also used it to share schedules and check-offs with customers.,Cons: There were a few features that I didn't understand or had trouble implementing but I'm pretty sure it was just a matter of familiarity.
944,944 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Libraries,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Easy project management interface”,"Overall: I use it to keep track of projects, both individual and collaborative.",9/11/2019,"Pros: I like how easy it is to use. I've encountered other task management solutions that I just can't wrap my head around. But Asana has a beautiful user interface, mobile integration, and tools for collaboration. I truly enjoy using it and it makes me more effective.","Cons: On a few occasions, I've bumped up against the cap for collaborative users on a team. That's just me being cheap, though- the service is worth paying for, but they give so much for free."
945,945 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Food & Beverages,2+ years,4,3,2,3,2,4,“Clunky software with very limited features”,"Overall: It can do the trick however there are much easier to use, cheaper options in the market.",24/9/2019,"Pros: It organizes things in a logical manner that's pretty easy to see everything that's going on and comment @ people, etc.","Cons: It feels extremely dated and has spent too much time on building out advanced features when Trello, Monday, Clickup, etc. have beaten them on ease of use."
946,946 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Museums and Institutions,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“Essential in running and tracking all our projects”,"Overall: We needed a unified tracking system where members of different teams could assign, delegate, and share all the tasks and materials needed to execute a wide variety of projects and initiatives. Asana has worked extremely well in that regard. And, while it is quite feature-packed, one can begin with just it's core functionality to easily onboard new users and add more advanced functions as needed.",20/9/2019,Pros: The ability to scale and customize the software to fit whatever implementation we needed.,Cons: Not much. We've been extremely satisfied. Maybe occasional downtime. But that's pretty rare.
947,947 Asana,Asana,Aksa V.,Digital Marketing Executive,Internet,2+ years,4,4,4,5,4,8,"“Simple UI, Easy to catch up”",Overall: Its a good option if your'e a beginner with project management software.,18/9/2019,"Pros: - Easy to use - Clean and catchy design - Lot of integrations and APIs available - Loved the recurring tasks feature, makes my monthly report reminder much easier",Cons: There's no direct customer support. There's nothing else I didn't like although I felt Freedcamp was a little more sleek and office friendly compared to Asana.
948,948 Asana,Asana,francisco b.,retail sales,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,4,3,3,8,“organize your work.”,"Overall: In general, I think it is an excellent tool to organize all your requirements and tasks to be done, to be able to organize all your needs in one place, and to be able to share it in your work or in your home with the people who need it, and update it to your decision",16/8/2019,"Pros: I love the ability to manage my goals and thus be able to concentrate on the fundamentals, I can also observe everything I need to do in a specific table that shows me the time I have for each task in an organized way integrating my emails, or notebook addresses, my calendar and block of notes, and to be able to share the information if I wish, and even better, I can use the free trial and thus allow you to try them before making any purchase.","Cons: It is a very basic and simple tool, but it is what it is designed for and I cannot find any error or defect to highlight, it is exceptional for organizing priorities."
949,949 Asana,Asana,David Q.,"Manager, Infrastructure",Retail,2+ years,5,4,5,4,4,10,“Best project software”,"Overall: It's been great. It fairly easy to use and, if you have issues, they have support by email (only) that is relatively quickly to respond.",11/8/2019,"Pros: I have a small team. We tried using Microsoft teams but it is severely lacking in the details we needed to capture. We need to track project that we are working on as a team. Asana allows us to schedule these projects, add tasks, and enter notes to keep it updated. You can include attachments and emails. It's exactly what I was looking for.",Cons: Only issue I have is that their minimum license package is 5; I only have a team of 3 so I am paying for licenses that I am not using.
950,950 Asana,Asana,Armando R.,Central VT,Media Production,2+ years,4,4,5,,4,9,“Daily management in a breeze”,Overall: Being a freelancer and having to work with plenty of people can be stressing and having things unorganized. Since i started with Asana thing got much more organized and the workflow between me and my partners/clients got much easier and fast.,7/8/2019,"Pros: I like how easy Asana is to organize my tasks and workflow. Creating, archiving or passing to other team members is a breeze. Everything seems smooth and the layout/design looks amazing.",Cons: I didn't find yet any con in Asana that can be worth mentioning.
951,951 Asana,Asana,Terry S.,Marketing Manager,Entertainment,2+ years,5,3,5,5,5,8,“Project Management and Collaboration Tools Made Easy”,,26/7/2019,,Cons: Some of the features in Asana are a little bit too robust and without being thoroughly explained what they do it can be a little overwhelming to navigate at times.
952,952 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Health,2+ years,5,5,4,,,9,“Excellent Workflow Management Tool ”,Overall: Using Asana has made it so much easier to collaborate and track projects our growing team is working on and our entire team uses it across various departments.,4/7/2019,Pros: Love the clean and fast interface. I also really like the ability to switch from timeline view to calendar to have a pulse on what your team is working on. I find it great for attaching project requests across teams and tracking dependencies.,"Cons: Might be a little confusing at first with all the bells and whistles, but as soon as you get the hang of it, you can truly customize the software to fit your needs."
953,953 Asana,Asana,Alessandro T.,IT Support Specialist,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,5,4,4,9,“A true solution!”,Overall:,21/6/2019,"Pros: Asana keeps us organized and helps in completing tasks before the deadline. Being a Team lead I can assign tasks and set due dates to complete them. This way everyone knows their job and everything remains streamlined. What I like the most about Asana is that we can attach URLs and comments to tasks, this way i don't have to send out an email explaining the specifics of a task.","Cons: The Interface can be tricky to navigate, it is difficult to locate the desired features at times. I would appreciate if we can customize the control according to our use and save those settings for permanently."

Asana seamlessly and effortlessly helps teams collaborate on day-to-day tasks, major projections, and special initiatives. I have used Asana both personally and professionally for two (2) years and it truly is the software I can't live without. Asana is user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing on both the desktop and mobile devices.",Cons: The ONLY con about Asana is the current slate of upgrades on the mobile app that make it harder to create sections.

Asana was great for our needs (we only have about 50 employees, so we were using the premium accounts). Our team heavily utilized templates, which were easy to duplicate for each marketing campaign. I also liked how you could create lists based off of saved advanced searches.","Cons: A few small things in functionality...sometimes you cant filter to exactly what you want to see (I would have trouble finding old tasks often). Also, the tag names always cut off and it's strange how something like that isn't an easy fix."
956,956 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,4,5,4,7,“Easy to get cluttered and get lost in the sea of tasks”,"Overall: We're using Asana to manage tasks and improve our productivity. But because of the cluttered project boards, it can work to your disadvantage. If Asana can find a way to make the project boards less cluttered and have a better way to categorize each task -- instead of showing them altogether -- I think it will improve greatly.",2/5/2019,"Pros: Asana is a great software for managing projects with a small number of tasks. I love how you can create a template for a project, then use that template over and over again -- virtually eliminating a lot of repetitive and unnecessary tasks when starting a new project.","Cons: Using Asana to manage my tasks was really overwhelming. Since all the tasks are shown on your board, you can easily get lost and be overwhelmed to the point when you don't know where to begin. I also don't like the organization of tasks where you have to click on a task before you see what project does it belong."
957,957 Asana,Asana,John W.,"Owner, Instructor",Sports,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Great Project Management Software”,,27/4/2019,,"Cons: I would like more features for the board view. I may not have explored it enough but it didn't seem that you could customize the colors of the ""notes"" on the board or change the font sizes. I think having this feature would make it feel more like a real post-it board and be easier to organize and visually separate out tasks."
958,958 Asana,Asana,Barbara C.,Senior Strategist,Design,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Outstanding and easy to use”,Overall: We have been successfully using Asana to streamline our projects and increase margins. It has helped us simplify our processes and serve our clients well. The team loves it and it makes my job as the project manager super easy. I can not recommend it enough.,2/4/2019,"Pros: I love the ease of use and short learning curve. We transitioned from Teamwork and we were up and running in a week. Clients use it and the team loves it. Good looking interface and great features like: dependable file, timeline and calendar view, boards, etc.",Cons: So far we are pretty happy with it! Wouldn't change it.
959,959 Asana,Asana,Steve K.,Software Engineer,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,4,4,3,,,7,“Great way to collaborate and track project progress”,Overall: Great way to manage project tasks and encourage collaboration.,27/3/2019,"Pros: The user interface is very clean and makes navigation quite easy. You can setup different projects, invite collaboraters, assign tasks, and track progress. Asana provides templates which are great for bootstrapping projects. For those that are constantly on the go, there are iOS and Android mobile apps. Finally, like all good SaaS offerings, they have an API and integrations for popular communications tools such as gdrive and slack. Pricing is also competitive, they have a free tier which is limited by number of users and a paid offering.","Cons: Occasionally the UI performance will suffer if there are too many things going on. The other quirk is that there is no way to track time using Asana. However for most simple projects, Asana offers enough to fit the bill."
960,960 Asana,Asana,Enovia B.,Business Development,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,4,,5,9,“To Free or not Free”,"Overall: I use this product for my team and also clients. The free version is more than adequate, but if you want to track your projects on a higher level the pro is a good investment. I'm thinking of permanently upgrading my membership soon.",14/3/2019,Pros: I love how easy it is to assign a task to all members of my team. The instant notifications allow me to go in and approve tasks for projects with ease.,Cons: A lot of email notifications. I assign a lot of tasks and it comes with the territory. I wish there was a way to batch tasks that have been completed at the same time into one email.

I love that members of my team can access the tool anywhere with an internet connection. Asana makes remote working more efficient and effective. Real-time updates show projects evolving and help me get a big picture view of things.",Cons: I always appreciate more feature updates.

963,963 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer & Network Security,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,9,“Perfect tool to manage your projects”,,2/2/2019,,Cons: There should be a way to communicate with other project members in the same tool. It would be good to apply a system of priorities to tasks and subtasks so that the progress of the percentage project is weighted.
964,964 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Human Resources,2+ years,5,4,4,5,4,9,“Enabled me to work worldwide with my team”,Overall: Better than expected. I'd tried several other workflow systems previously but Asana proved to be best suited to my business needs.,22/1/2019,"Pros: Super easy to see at a quick snapshot of where everyone is at a glance, and I can comment and approve projects with one click. Love that I can set up 'master' projects with dependent actions, and that cleint correspdondence and files are all housed in the one space.","Cons: The only thing that is frustrating is that I cannot delete a comment on a project if that comment is made by a subordinate - I need to get them to delete it. I can't edit a comment that I post either, and when you're working on large projects teams in multiple time zones, it can really hold projects up."

I've tried a lot of different softwares/apps to keep be organized, and I have to say that Asana is the best so far. It has helped me prioritize my tasks and keep me on track. I definitely recommend Asana as it is very easy to use and navigate.","Cons: I don't have any issues to report. Since I've been using it, the design has been revisited which has made it more appealing and intuitive."
966,966 Asana,Asana,Denys O.,Director of Marketing,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,4,,,9,“Does the job well and it is easy to use”,,17/1/2019,,"Cons: As a long time user, I've seen the product improve a lot, specially the apps, but I've also seen some (free) features being pushed to the paid version. So if you are looking just for a free tool, you may not be able to use some more advanced project management and reports."
967,967 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,4,5,4,8,“Asana Premium User - 60 user org”,Overall: It has dramatically improved the communication and efficiency of our organization.,16/1/2019,"Pros: I like the UI, especially the recent updates. It is very easy to navigate. Most of the features seem very well thought out, with the end user in mind. Obviously a good team behind this product.","Cons: It doens't take too long for the screen to become 'crowded'. I think the recent UI updates have fixed this alot, but this to an extent. I'd like to see a 'minimalist' or 'focused' view in the future. At least as an option in the settings, I think this would be incredible to users that need to focus in on the next task at hand. As opposed to being constantly reminded of the next 5 things that need to be done after the next task."
968,968 Asana,Asana,Oliver B.,SEO Strategist,Financial Services,2+ years,5,4,4,,4,8,“Essential for startups”,"Overall: Took me a little while to get my head around it coming from Trello, but now it's the core of my workflow.",20/12/2018,"Pros: Easy to organise projects and tasks and keep communication in the right place under the exact task that it relates to. This is also a very versatile tool, you can keep content ideas in one column and then a kanban board in the following columns and build your workflow as you like.","Cons: Assigning members to tasks and boards isn't always clear, I'm not sure which tasks everyone can see and this creates extra back and forth."
969,969 Asana,Asana,Sarah M.,Software Engineer,Information Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,10,“Superb platform with team coordination”,Overall:,17/12/2018,"Pros: The best part that I love about Asana is that through this I can have strong interaction with my teammates because of its collaborative nature. Through this we can easily plan tasks. Moreover, the color coding capability of Asana is appreciable. I like its smooth and incredibly simple interface that looks very attractive. I like the interactive as well as colorful design aspects of Asana. Most interesting features of Asana are the ability of creating multiple tasks as well as project templates in fantastic ways.","Cons: I feel quite difficult to find cons in this awesome product. When I started using this product, it seems to be quite difficult but soon I started getting familiar with all of its features then I feel easy to use this product. So one of the limitations is that user needs to learn its features before using it. Moreover it lacks the option of instant messaging which I think should be included in order to get more benefits out of it."

You can even add subtasks within tasks, add attachments, links and sync with Slack, Google Docs, etc. You can also have conversations within Asana to keep track of task questions, etc.","Cons: It's not as intuitive as you'd like it to be, but once you move around in it, you'll get the hang of it pretty quick."
971,971 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Retail,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Love Asana”,"Overall: Asana is a great tool for managing day-to-day tasks. I highly recommend this over anything else out there. However, if your a Development team, I would recommend something specifically designed for developers.",14/12/2018,Pros: - Easy to use - Easy to track various tasks - You can sub task any task (including subtasks) making it easy to manage multiple people sharing a task. - Great sharing/permission settings so only those who need to see things will see what they need. - Multiple ways to organize your tasks - Set custom task values - Lots of integrations to improve workflows,Cons: - Reporting on productivity isn't really there. - It's not the best for managing Dev tasks - difficult to keep track of tasks as they pile up.

Handles all tasks assignments for us. 10/10”,Overall: We needed a way to stream line assignments and progress on those assigments. Asana allowed us to do that for free and did it well.,11/12/2018,Pros: I love that you can choose the board view or the list view. Both are great for different reasons. I also love that the the free version really has some muscle power still. We used the free version for 3 years then went to the paid and still love it. It works so well and is so affordable.,Cons: The only thing I least liked about the software was it's integration with Google Calendar. I wish it was a liitle more robust.

I'm in Asana everyday and it is what I use to organize all my projects and tasks I need to delegate and my own tasks. It was the only project mgt app that met my requirements.,"Cons: I didn't have too hard a time to get used to the user-interface (UI) but I know many of my colleagues had a tough time getting used to it. Once they get used to it, it's perfectly fine."
974,974 Asana,Asana,Paulo A.,SEO,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,5,5,3,10,“Asana is great for remote teams to work together”,Overall: Asana has helped me and my company to make more in less time. That's super important these days.,16/10/2018,"Pros: I've been using Asana for the last months with JivoChat and our team. It's incredible how it made easier for us to make tasks go to the finish line. It's incredible the capacity to make subtasks and tasks become projects, because, as they grow, you can make them include more people and functionality.","Cons: It depends very much on people skills to use it. Let me say why. When you have a big task that needs subtasks and those subtasks need new people to join, most of the time some coworkers will add you in both tasks. That is not the point. You should be added just for the smaller task. When you finish it, you are off the hook. Also, the payment system is a little too agressive for small companies. But the free version is good enough for most companies, I guess."
975,975 Asana,Asana,Michelle Y.,Credentialing Operations Manager,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Great project management tool!”,,3/10/2018,,"Cons: If staff members aren't using Asana continuously, people may forget how to use it. Definitely a tool you need to consistently use."
976,976 Asana,Asana,Dan U.,Founder,Health,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“I love asana!”,,6/9/2018,,"Cons: Honestly, nothing. It's not enterprise level, I feel so if you're anything smaller than a super large company it's good. Might tie into github or source control a little better, but they do an ok job with it."
977,977 Asana,Asana,Dylan S.,Manager,Entertainment,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,9,“Asana Fantastic For Small Business Team”,"Overall: Asana has become an integral part of our business. It gives us a clearer picture of what's on the go and serves as a huge time saver, negating the need for meetings, to remind each other of certain tasks and helping to avoid communication errors.",2/9/2018,Pros: We are a small business with a team of 3 staff members. Asana is well designed for managing the team workflows and task-management. Assigning tasks and deadlines is a game changers when it comes to maintenance and prioritising. I personally am checking Asana daily just to get a clear picture of what's going on - like a super advanced to do list. Fast and responsive. Free version is more than enough for our needs - it almost seems criminal not paying for it,Cons: The only downside I can think of is there is no offline capabilities. I often have to travel for work and would love to be able to check Asana on planes and outside of reception.

It helps us stay planned and organized as we can map out every step of a project, assign tasks to people, and communicate effectively about the project. I also love that there is a mobile app for working on the go",Cons: I have zero complaints about this software. It is absolutely critical to managing our projects and meeting deadlines. It has worked flawlessly for us!
979,979 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,1001-5000 employees,2+ years,5,4,5,5,4,10,“Adds order into the process of running multiple projects”,"Overall: If your team is less than 15 people, free version of Asana would be the best option for you to start. Some paid features will require upgrading. However, my team managed to use free version for almost two years. We upgraded to paid version only when our team grew and we had to add more people to our workspace. Check for Asana user cases posted in their blogs",17/7/2018,"Pros: My favorite Asana feature is when it automatically creates a task when I send it to special email. Many other apps do this, but Asana creates tasks from emails just as I expect it. I've tried many of task and project management tools. Asana is so successful for one simple reason, its dashboard looks like an inbox. Most people send and get their task by email and get used to inbox design and structure. I believe that's the reason why it is so easy to start using Asana.","Cons: Default notifications settings can be annoying. There is no inbuilt feature to prioritizing tasks. Instead we had to use tags. I think Asana is mostly a desktop tool. Yes, they do have a good mobile app, but only a big screen allows you to get maximum of Asana."
980,980 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Higher Education,2+ years,4,5,4,,,9,“Great for seeing all tasks for me and my team in one place”,,15/7/2018,,"Cons: I wish fewer steps were required for assigning the same task to multiple people - it takes too many clicks to duplicate a task, change details, and re-assign to another person on my team. Also, this is a small thing, but I've inadvertently created a lot of blank tasks by simply clicking around in a task list, which I then later need to delete."
981,981 Asana,Asana,Louie F.,CFO,Printing,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana has allowed our printing company to create a work production management system”,Overall: very beneficial for our business and couldn't be happier with the day to day outcome from Asana's performance.,15/5/2018,"Pros: The software is easy to use and the staff at Asana are quick to respond to questions and/or issues. They will help you every step of the way to help you make Asana work in your business, including recommending how to utilize Zaps, to get it to do what you need to....very amazing product and team.","Cons: At this point, there are few issues that I would talk about here with Asana...Maybe the only thing that is possibly keeping me from utilizing is the cost. I wish that they would have a feature where you could add ""seat"" by one at a time, instead of being forced to purchase 5 at a time, which you may never need."
982,982 Asana,Asana,Larzel C.,Business Development Manager,Real Estate,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,9,“This is my bestfriend everyday.”,"Overall: If you're a businessman or entrepreneur and need some organization with your everyday work, get Asana it's a great investment.",10/5/2018,"Pros: I love this software because I've used it for everything I do. From trainings to meetings and even for tasks I need to assign my assistant. The options to add subtasks, create dropdown option for projects and a lot more makes it the most amazing tool I need that is essential for my job.","Cons: Unless you get the Premium feature, you wont get the best things from Asana just a a usual checklist. I got the premium so I got the best!"

Keeps me organized.”,Overall: Helps to keep me organized and promotes better communication with co-workers.,5/5/2018,Pros: I wanted a simple and easy to use task manager to keep me organized and help me to not forget any tasks. Asana does this perfectly! I can prioritize my tasks which I love. I can also assign tasks to my co-workers which has been super helpful and helps to create better communication. The program also looks so sleek.,Cons: I really have no problems with Asana. It has never lost a task or stopped working for me. Myself and my co-workers love using Asana.
984,984 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,4,5,4,9,“Asana helped me and my team to organize our work and to keep track on everything.”,Overall: It helped me be more organized and have everything I would like to work on in one place.,4/5/2018,"Pros: - how you can have multiple teams, projects, sections, tasks and subtasks to keep every project and every part of the organization on track - its very good integration with other tools, for example with timesheet tools - the automated task sender integration - being able to have recurrent tasks, which helps not to forget about them - it's easy to assign a task - being able to see all you tasks organized by due date or projects - being able to easily upload files - that you can organize the project by sections, by lists, as a dashboard, as it's easy for you","Cons: - for someone not very techy, it can be more difficult to adjust to using it - quite expensive tool when you have more people in the organization and you want them to all work in the same team"
985,985 Asana,Asana,"Avishay ""Jesse"" S.",CEO,Management Consulting,2+ years,5,4,5,4,4,10,“I had used Asana extensively while working with startups and innovations centers.”,"Overall: Very easy to use once you get the hang of it, Google Calendar integration was a life saver at times and the fact that I could divide subjects into groups and upload relevant projects up and integrate them with other options was great",11/4/2018,"Pros: Asana is a very straightforward solution; as a user, it is very easy to create groups to use the system easily and efficiently, follow up on projects and many other aspects that the only other platform that provides a similar service was Slack. I also liked the fact that I could sync it with my Google Calendar, which made meeting scheduling a walk in the park.","Cons: Asana may need some work done when it comes to onboarding. It took me a couple of days to get the hang of it, but it's not a deal breaker."
986,986 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,4,,,9,“Has really helped with cross-department communication”,,10/4/2018,,"Cons: The ""My Profile"" settings could be more intuitive. But once I figured out how to adjust these I haven't had to go back in and make any changes. The only real drawback is that this software is only truly effective if other team members adopt it. We still have some outliers who don't use it as often/well as other, and we end up saying ""Did you check Asana"" or ""Did you put that in Asana"" a lot. This will probably get better over time."
987,987 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,,“Team Productivity”,,7/2/2018,,"Cons: I don't like that if you don't purchase the software, you are only limited to 3 projects. We don't have it in our budget to be able to purchase, but I am sure the paid version is better."
988,988 Asana,Asana,Yaroslav K.,Information Technology Major,Higher Education,2+ years,5,5,5,3,5,10,“One app to rule them all”,"OverallPros: Easy and intuitive UI Great functionality (subtasks, tracking, commenting,calendar,todays to-dos...etc) Unbelievably fast even after continuous usage Reliable",6/2/2018,,"Cons: The only one thing I am expecting is - better synchronization options with other apps (calendars, to-do programs like Todoist and Wunderlist... etc.) Overall, the app does everything it promises and even more. Never been disappointed and advice it to everyone with many projects for handling daily tasks and scheduling work by priority. On the personal side - I use it also to organize my study material (I am an IT student) and it works just great. Looking forward to new features and development of the product."
989,989 Asana,Asana,Ashlee B.,Special Project Coordinator,11-50 employees,2+ years,5,4,5,5,,,“Project Management made Blissful”,,20/1/2018,,"Cons: There is a bit of a learning curve, which means if you aren't using the system in an optimized way it could actually make you less productive. I recommend taking some time to get to know the software inside and out before you start relying on it for major projects."
990,990 Asana,Asana,Becky K.,Director GTM,Unspecified,2+ years,4,5,4,2,,,“Great tool- great for managing task And cross functional teams”,,9/1/2018,,Cons: Duplication of task caused by a glitch. Email notification is distracting but can be turned off in settings
991,991 Asana,Asana,Lisa M.,Vice President,11-50 employees,2+ years,5,5,5,3,5,10,“Asana has elevated the efficiency across my agency and my clients' project management experience!”,"Overall: We are delivering such a higher level of project management value to our clients and we've been able to infuse greater efficiency across our team because of how many customizable features the software has. We were previously using Basecamp for years and have almost switched to other platforms at least a dozen times. Basecamp has a lot of positives but lacked some key features (assigning recurring todos, easily allowing multiple people to follow a specific task, limiting calendar view/functions) and Asana is finally the platform that has it all.",12/12/2017,"Pros: Wow, there is so much to like. I love the easy integration with google drive, the intuitive structure that is super easy for anyone to quickly grasp and the ability to customize unique views and dashboards so everyone gets the view and reporting and insights that matter most to them individually.","Cons: I don't like that adding a subtask in a project tile requires clicking the subtask icon. This is the one non-intutive or unnatural function to me. When I enter a tile within a project, I can just start typing and this feels like it should be adding a subtask but really it's entering a note in task list overall. I've messed this up several times"
992,992 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Media Production,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“Intuitive and powerful project management tool”,,7/12/2017,,"Cons: There is a bit of a learning curve for those who have never used a similar software, and it takes some time to customize the settings to the way you like to use it, but that is par for the course for any project management software. Once it's set up it works very smoothly."
993,993 Asana,Asana,Michelle L.,Marketing Communications Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,3,5,,,“Great tool for staying organized”,,28/11/2017,,"Cons: Asana gives users the ability to create sub tasks, which is great, but unfortunately they are somewhat hidden and are hard to find. Not a great tool for project flow work but works great as a task list to keep you on track."
994,994 Asana,Asana,Anna A.,CEO / Marketing Manager,11-50 employees,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,"“Asana is an amazing platform, we use it to keep our company running smoothly!”",Overall: We wouldn't be able to run our company without this software so I can't even list all of the benefits as they are endless.,25/11/2017,"Pros: It's very user-friendly, they are always adding new features and integrations for our team to use. We have tried other software solutions but they don't come close to what Asana provides.","Cons: Yikes, it's really hard to find something that we don't like about the platform. The only thing that would be nice is if you could switch projects from a board style to a list style project. Other than that all of my pet issues they have resolved!"
995,995 Asana,Asana,Janice W.,Admin,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Value for Money; the most functional task list I've ever had”,"Overall: I don't have to worry about forgetting anything, and that gives me the confidence to move on with my day and get things done.",15/11/2017,"Pros: Asana is super customizable, and effectively tracks any kind of task or project you need. I've been able to rely on my timelines in Asana, which means I don't have to worry about missing a deadline. They also really listen to customer feedback, as some of my remarks have resulted in change to the system within only a few months.","Cons: The jump from free user to paid business use is pretty steep, but you can do SO much with the free version, I feel that by the time you are needing to pay for the upgraded version, you really know your way around and are going to be getting the most value by upgrading."
996,996 Asana,Asana,Mitch B.,Founder,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“This software runs our business”,"Overall: Formerly we were with Basecamp, and found that the team wasn't using the software that much. When we switched to Asana that changed, and now everyone is engaged and using it daily to track tasks and projects.",8/11/2017,"Pros: It's so straightforward and easy to use, that I've never had to actually contact support. How amazing is that?","Cons: I can't think of anything at the moment. Asana is just rock solid. If I had to be nit picky, sometimes once you had added someone to a project (EG: A client or contractor) it can be a little confusing on how to actually remove that person 100% from the system."
997,997 Asana,Asana,Chelsea S.,Marketing Specialist,Architecture & Planning,2+ years,4,4,4,5,5,8,“Love Asana”,Overall: I love using Asana for personal tasks. It is not optimal for project management though. I think that there are always features being added and it's a bit hard to keep up. I think keeping the experience simple is always best.,17/11/2016,Pros: I like how you can see your tasks in a number of different views. The search functionality is great.,Cons: It is hard to know what project/task a subtask belongs to when the person who it is assigned to does not own the overall task. I think tags and priorities are kind of crowding the UI making it look a little bit daunting making it a little bit harder to teach new users how to use it.
998,998 Asana,Asana,Caleb C.,Web Developer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,4,,,8,"“We use asana, and we like it.”",Overall: We started using asana on a software development team. It's better than using github issues for us because non-technical people are interacting with us on asana easily. It does all the basics really well. It is one of these 'just works' products - we like it.,3/11/2016,"Pros: Things get automatically linked together really easily - project to project, project to task, @'ing other people, screenshot thumbnails. This is expected -- but it's done really well. Also the new feature - 'customized fields' is actually a really important thing. We love that.","Cons: Can't paste screenshots directly into comments/projects. Sub-tasks never really work out - we dont use those. Project description is hidden, so when people put important stuff there, it's basically lost."
999,999 Asana,Asana,Catherine W.,Office Manager,Executive Office,2+ years,4,5,4,5,5,10,“I Love Asana!”,"Overall: This software makes keeping up with multiple tasks/projects so easy! I have no idea how companies function without it. On projects with multiple parts and participants, it's very efficient to be able to see notes from other parties and keep them up to speed on what I have done and what is left for completion by all.",3/11/2016,Pros: Very easy to use and I appreciate the constant updates with training on adding the features to your process.,"Cons: I can't put higher priority tasks in order. When I have MULTIPLE tasks that need to be done in one day or one week, I would like to be able to move them up or down in line for a particular day."
1000,1000 Asana,Asana,Angie S.,Development Associate,Philanthropy,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Great way to get our team on the same page”,"OverallPros: Asana is easy to use by offering a great way to organize projects, tasks and team members who need to know what's happening. Our team really likes the email reminders because we have some people who don't like to log into Asana itself, but with the emails they stay on top of tasks that are due. We also like the functionality where you can reply to an email and it saves it in the project on Asana, which makes conversations easy to use but also saves them. We love being able to upload files so everything is right there for everyone on the project to see at any time. The calendar view is nice so you can see what is coming up. We like the ability to add guests so outside vendors or other people can also be part of the projects.",25/8/2016,,Cons: I can't think of anything that I don't like at this time. It is just a great product that has really helped our team.
1001,1001 Asana,Asana,Stephane G.,"Partner, Growth Strategy | Management Consultant",Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,3,3,3,4,6,“Great for Simple Workflows and Operating Models”,"Overall: I've used this across various companies for the last 7 years. It's come a long way. For simple departments, it makes sense as the cost is low. The API is open enough to integrate other tools at a basic level.",9/10/2020,Pros: Easy to stand up and train on the basics of project management. New features make it a bit easier to report on progress and roll up projects into Portfolios.,Cons: Goals are a bit disconnected. Seems like a good concept but not well thought out. Takes a considerate amount of time to keep them updated and associated correctly.
1002,1002 Asana,Asana,Breanna (Bre) H.,Assistant Director,Higher Education,2+ years,5,5,5,3,5,10,“We love Asana!”,"Overall: I have loved Asana and recommend it to everyone I know. It helps me to stay organized, it helps me manage the groups of students in a much more efficient way, and I love seeing what others have been able to check off and what they're still working on.",28/7/2020,"Pros: This product is a lifesaver as well as a timesaver. It has helped our team of students, staff, and faculty coordinate major projects and prevented anything from falling through the cracks. I have greater peace of mind knowing that Asana is helping me track all of our tasks and various projects.",Cons: The subtasks under each main task can get lost/hidden pretty easily. I also wish that there was an option to copy an entire list over to a new list instead of only being able to export and re-import.
1003,1003 Asana,Asana,Jennifer P.,Academic Coordinator,Education Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,8,“Not so great for Event Management”,Overall: Great.,22/6/2020,"Pros: I like how easy it is to get around in Asana, and how there are many different ways to accomplish the same task -- marking something as completed, searching for tasks, assigning tasks -- depending where one is in the program.","Cons: I wish there were a way to better use Asana for event management -- where there's a due date and a run date for events, or a due date for a task and then a span of time for events. It would make this program the ultimate program management software."
1004,1004 Asana,Asana,Edoardo M.,Operations Manager,Design,2+ years,5,4,4,5,4,8,“How Blossom uses Asana”,,19/6/2020,,Cons: I'd like asana to have better reporting features. There was an integration with Google Spreadhseets I had liked to have seen improved rather than canceled
1005,1005 Asana,Asana,Odessa R.,Training Coordinator,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Awesome Project Management App”,"Overall: I've been using Asana for more than a year now, and I'm satisfied. Since it can be connected to other apps (for example, Hubstaff and Hubspot), it's easy to automate task stages, whether in the productivity tracking side or sales side. I've got a great experience with the software overall.",28/5/2020,"Pros: I like that it's got built-in templates that you can easily copy for certain project goals. You can also create your own templates and use them over and over again, which is helpful when handling repeat projects. You also got an optional list of board views.","Cons: I hope there's an option to assign a task to multiple people, so you won't have to create duplicate tasks. It has that option to add collaborators, though."
1006,1006 Asana,Asana,Darren F.,CEO,Education Management,2+ years,4,5,5,,,10,“A Great Way to Manage Tasks and To-Do Lists”,"Overall: Again, amazing. You can even create sub-tasks within tasks! Just be careful while using it, you might get addicted to the dopamine hit of clicking ""Task Completed!""",7/5/2020,"Pros: I love Asana. It's basically a giant, interactive to-do list for an entire company. You can leave comments, ask questions, set deadlines, the works. It's great, has a lot of options and functionality, and the design is not too shabby itself.","Cons: The only odd thing about Asana is that it has to reset itself a lot. Why? Because they apparently update the app every day or so, and they ask if it's ok for Asana to restart. It's not a big deal at all though, since it literally takes seconds, but just something to keep in mind."
1007,1007 Asana,Asana,Kaajal P.,Account Coordinator,Entertainment,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Awesome remote collaborative platform”,Overall:,1/4/2020,Pros: I love that Asana allows for so much flexibility in creating different projects and tasks for clients. This is what keeps my head on straight when dealing with so many different clients on a day to day basis and also allows me to track the work other employees and interns are conducting.,"Cons: If anything, Asana could be improved with more automation to in completing tasks when creating and completing projects and subtasks."
1008,1008 Asana,Asana,Logan S.,"Associate, Creative Services",Financial Services,2+ years,4,5,4,,,8,“Asana is a solid project management tool with multiple uses”,,1/4/2020,,"Cons: When working with a multitude of teams, Asana can become easy to lose track of if you don't maintain the organised workflow. We have found on occasion we'd have to spend time re-organising tasks to ensure we're 100% sure where those tasks are at in the workflow."
1009,1009 Asana,Asana,Krishna L.,Customer Service Representative,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,5,5,4,4,8,“I use Asana to organize projects with my team”,"Overall: Asana may be a critical tool for managing our team, projects and execution.

No affiliation, just a recommendation on content that has helped us intensify our Asana game.",1/4/2020,Pros: I love the power to share tasks with team members and assign tasks and subtasks on to others. It makes organizing a project incredibly efficient and streamlined.,Cons: As I even have been using Asana for several years it's providing fantastic services. i actually love its features and functionalities. it's an awesome place for managing all tasks.

1011,1011 Asana,Asana,Kay S.,Email Marketing Specialist,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,2,4,,,4,"“It has a lot of features, but the ease of use for common scenarios is really lacking.”","Overall: For serious project management, there are easier tools to use that offer almost as much power and flexibility. If your organization has a common project workflow, then all that flexibility and customization opportunities are probably wasted anyway.",25/2/2020,"Pros: Asana allows for quite a bit of customization in how you set up your projects and tasks - on a project level, but also on an individual user level, allowing different users to view their own tasks in the way that suits them best.","Cons: It's not very intuitive to use. The inline editing with no deliberate save options makes it all too easy to accidentally overwrite text without even realizing. The interface is complex and on the account level that I was using (a lower paid level, not the free level) it's frustrating to click on an interface item only to find it's only available in higher account levels."
1012,1012 Asana,Asana,Mike C.,IT Director,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,4,4,4,4,8,“Great for Productivity and Collaboration ”,Overall: Been a great tool for us. Once users started seems it's power it really started being a big benefit.,24/2/2020,Pros: It's simple and easy to use and is web based with companion apps so it can be used on any device. Great collaboration tool with task assigning and tagging individuals so they see whatever you need them to see.,Cons: The free version is great for one person or maybe a small team. But if you want to really leverage the power of this software you need a fairly large team and will also need to pay for a subscription.
1013,1013 Asana,Asana,Betty M.,CEO,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“Asana”,Overall: For a small company set up Asana is the best software for organizing projects because you don't need to be a guru to operate Asana perfectly.,20/1/2020,Pros: Both the desktop and mobile app has an intuitive user interface which makes It quite easy to create and organize project on Asana and creating sub-task under a project. The free version is packed with lots of features which is absolutely useful for a small scale business and it integrates with other software for easy data transfer. Asana updates their software frequently for a better service.,"Cons: Gantt charts feature is locked behind the pay wall, you are going to need to pay a certain amount per month per user in order to use Gantt chart, which is provided for free or less on other similar product like Google sheet. It is very easy to lose track of conversation on Asana especially if the task is been marked complete, and you have already archived it from inbox."
1014,1014 Asana,Asana,Hannah S.,Postdoctoral Scholar,Higher Education,2+ years,5,4,4,,5,7,“Great tool to manage collaborative projects and teams”,Overall: I have really enjoyed using Asana and it has allowed me to set daily goals for my work,5/1/2020,"Pros: This software is great to set deadlines and manage team projects. Asana enables setting goals, setting deadlines, and marking goals completed for users across devices and is updated in real-time.","Cons: This software can be difficult to navigate at first, but users quickly adapt!"
1015,1015 Asana,Asana,Shilpa S.,Marketing manager,Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,2,2,8,“Collaboration across cross functions made simple”,Overall: I love this tool because I can look at all the task list under one roof and track progress too.,31/12/2019,"Pros: As soon as you have a task for teams that have huge dependence, just raise a task and it will be done depending on the due date set. It's easy to manage all the projects in one place",Cons: Limited number of teams. Please increase the capacity of people that can be added to one team to manage tasks prevalent for that team. Maybe you can add a completion timeless so that we don't have to go through all the comments.
1016,1016 Asana,Asana,David C.,COO,Media Production,2+ years,4,4,4,,4,8,“Best one we found”,"Overall: We use Asana for our media production (video, graphics, websites) company to plan, track, and complete projects. It is helpful overall and does what we need it to do. The more we use it, the better we use it.",3/12/2019,"Pros: Asana makes it easy to plan out a project, assign tasks, set task and project due dates, and keep up with progress. It's fairly customizable, making it usable by a variety of companies.","Cons: All the best stuff (Gantt charts, etc.) costs a little more. We found the cost to outweigh the benefits for the more advanced features."
1017,1017 Asana,Asana,Ernie D.,VP Digital Marketing,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Great Tool for Collaboration”,,13/11/2019,,"Cons: My one critique is that I wish there was an option to have conversations sorted by activity. Otherwise, no complaints at all."
1018,1018 Asana,Asana,Kristen G.,Operations Manager,Construction,2+ years,4,5,5,5,5,8,“User Friendly ”,Overall:,13/11/2019,Pros: Multiple user functionality. You know who was inputting information and when. You could track group projects as well as individual. It was a great tool to use for my employees to keep track of their day while I was out of office. Could check in anywhere.,Cons: Older items kept popping up. Would have to completely delete to keep out of the current tasks rather than archive.
1019,1019 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Publishing,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Keep your workflow organized! ”,"Overall: Project management, working remote with a team, taking accountability for tasks",6/11/2019,"Pros: Whether you are naturally organized or not, this is such a great way to hold teams accountable for their tasks in a workflow. Each use has to check off their tasks as they have done them. Work flows are easy to create and manage in a platform.","Cons: It is a web-based program so you have to have internet and it is a paid product, but worth the price if you have a remote team or just need a project management software!"
1020,1020 Asana,Asana,Farryn M.,CEO,Online Media,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Love this program! ”,Overall: This program keeps our team on task and focused. We all are on the same page and stay connected.,30/10/2019,"Pros: It's easy to use, Keeps me task focused and helps my team know what to focus on next too. I love hitting the done button",Cons: Nothing! It's seriously great. If I had to find one con it would be that you can only assign a task to one persons
1021,1021 Asana,Asana,Charissa M.,Paralegal,Legal Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana Review”,Overall:,15/10/2019,"Pros: Extremely user friendly, links to Outlook with no issues, great customer service I personally did not choose it, but am glad it became available. I like it a lot better than Outlook. I love that you can keep all conversations and documents in one link. Once done, check the task complete. Then, if needed, go back to easily find tasks that have been completed. We also use it for conflicts checks purposes and I love being able to use the tags.","Cons: The new layout - I am not a fan of the new layout but with all things technical, I will get used to the change"
1022,1022 Asana,Asana,Christian O.,Designer,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,7,“Good task manager”,Overall: I like the calendar feature (and you can have the tasks appear in your own Google Calendar too). The Google singe sign-on feature is useful too. There are a lot of other features and options so it's pretty customisable to suit your needs.,3/9/2019,"Pros: I can quickly see what tasks I have to complete today, and for the rest of the week and I can see what my colleagues are working on. So overall it gives me a helpful overview of the state of projects.",Cons: There are some annoying bugs and the user interface isn't quite as easy to use as it could be.
1023,1023 Asana,Asana,Kari C.,Marketing Manager,Publishing,2+ years,5,4,4,,,9,“Best way to tackle tasks & projects”,,1/9/2019,,"Cons: I can't figure out how to create sections in the free version of the software. Granted, I haven't asked for help with this yet."
1024,1024 Asana,Asana,Michael C.,Recruiter,Education Management,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Amazing Tool for Organizing Your To Do List!”,Overall: Our team uses it daily to communicate and assign tasks to one another and benefits us as whole as a result.,6/8/2019,"Pros: Asana is such a great way to have a visual representation of what you need to get done. Not only that but the extensive features within it are amazing. Such as attaching important files, setting recurring tasks, commenting and tagging team members. I've only scratched the surface with it since it has multiple other features but it really helps me out just with what I've used it with. Also the app is great and how the tasks update across everything no matter which device you are using.","Cons: I like to sort by Due Date and then within that switch the tasks around within the due dates but does not allow me to do that. So I have to manually sort everything by day which isnt a huge issue, more of a minor inconvenience :)"
1025,1025 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Accounting,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Asana is my life!”,,3/5/2019,,Cons: I have used it for 1.5 years now. The only thing I would like to see differently is the ability to sort by due date and project on my main page under my tasks. That way I can get a quick overview of everything rather then going into each project.
1026,1026 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Accounting,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Excellent task managing software”,Overall: I have had up to 4 employees and we use asana to assign tasks to each other each months. I feel nothing gets missed as long as dated and assigned to someone.,3/5/2019,Pros: That's it has a free option. Ease of use. Its functionality,Cons: I haven't found a single thing I don't like about it except maybe all the notifications. Had to turn of emails as I was getting too many. Don't know why they need a notification when someone finishes a task. Wish that was a setting to turn off so I only see notifications when someone leaves a comment.
1027,1027 Asana,Asana,Miha A.,Head of Marketing / Client Service,Internet,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,“Built on user feedback”,,2/5/2019,,"Cons: Slight feature bloat (compared to the initial simpliciy from a few years back), making some interactions with the app more complicated than necessaty. I found myslef having to learn to use the software instead of ""getting it"" immediately."
1028,1028 Asana,Asana,Carter F.,Marketing Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,3,,,7,“Amazing Design; Minimal Features”,"Overall: I enjoyed using Asana, it has a very user-friendly design and makes task tracking easy. If you're looking for a large suite of features, however, Asana is a bit limiting.",25/4/2019,Pros: The set up of tasks and teams made this a good project management system for our team. The design is very user-friendly and easy to use.,"Cons: As we grew it became difficult to accommodate some of the larger projects into Asana. In addition, other tools offered more features that our creative agency was in need of. Time tracking, contingent task requirements, etc."
1029,1029 Asana,Asana,Shane S.,Branch Coordinator,Real Estate,2+ years,4,5,4,,5,9,“Aesthetically Pleasing Project Management at an Affordable Price”,,19/4/2019,,"Cons: How does a company of this size with this many clients not have a mac app? Actively working I have over a dozen tabs open, often multiple browsers. For something as important as my project manager I really want to be able to have it separate."
1030,1030 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,5,5,4,10,“Best Project Management Tool I've Used”,"Overall: Love it! I've used Trello, Basecamp, and Jira, but Asana is my favorite out of all of them.",5/4/2019,"Pros: This tool makes task management super easy. I love the project feature and the ability to add a task to multiple projects. It makes it so my team can have our running list of projects, we can collaborate with other teams on a task, and they can still have their own projects/tasks.",Cons: I wish that the portfolio feature wasn't an additional cost. I understand why they did it (because it's awesome) I just wish my team had it
1031,1031 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,E-Learning,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana User”,Overall:,2/4/2019,"Pros: Great for project management, assigning out tasks to other users and breaking down tasks into actionable items on growing larger projects. Looks nice and easy UI that ties into time tracking software.",Cons: The notification emails that come to your inbox can be counter productive to efficiently managing a project and the number can bog you down and take out additional time in your day.
1032,1032 Asana,Asana,Edgar S.,Service Desk Technician,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Very helpful”,Overall:,12/3/2019,"Pros: Asana is a very simple straight forward tool, it can be as simple as you'd like but it can also be very in depth. You can organize multiple categories, and create several different task lists based on team, department, location, etc. The inbox features and the my tasks feature is awesome so that you can focus on what is assigned to you.","Cons: Sometimes the UI can be a little clunky, especially when trying to re organize a task list that has a lot of info."
1033,1033 Asana,Asana,Andrea S.,Owner,Information Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Amazing for the value!!”,"Overall: We do all our social media and website projects using this tool. You can let clients see what you want, have tasks like home work for just them, assign them stuff to review. It's wonderful",6/3/2019,"Pros: I love that the free version you can work in a team. Who does this? No one. I love the calendar feature, where you can load pictures, documents and assign it to people. I love that you can leave comments based on the post and track conversations that way. The progress manager is good as well.","Cons: I wish it had a time tracking piece. I wish it had a simple invoicing section Also a simple contact section to add vendor names for projects, ability to email them they the program."
1034,1034 Asana,Asana,Kelsie K.,Director of Human Resources,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,4,4,3,,,7,“Use it for Help Desk Tickets”,"Overall: We use Asana for help desk tickets and it enhanced the productivity and customer service level. You can see exactly when the ticket came in, who is the owner, read the entire conversations/exchanges, and closed date. It is a good tool to track and collect data also.",20/2/2019,"Pros: 1. Easy to use 2. Can assign the owner 3. Can manage the status easily 4. Can access incoming and outgoing replies via Google email, no log into a new window/site 5. Can easily access the data, outcome/productivity",Cons: The layout and design can improve... visual layout
1035,1035 Asana,Asana,Allison K.,Middle School Youth Pastor,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,4,5,4,,,8,“You can run but you can't hide”,,5/2/2019,,"Cons: If you don't mind the clean design of this program, you won't have any issues with this program. My creative mindset wishes for some more color combinations in the homepage layout. Other than that, which I can easily get over, this program does what I need it to do."
1036,1036 Asana,Asana,Michal T.,Founder,E-Learning,2+ years,5,3,5,5,5,9,“Truly sophisticated task management software.”,Overall: I have been switching between a lot of task managers. Asana allowed me to have multiple collaborators and see progress of our projects easily.,11/1/2019,"Pros: It has sooo many features. Even the free version. If you are dissatisfied with other task managers and you are looking for additional features Asana might be for you. It has projects with beautiful dashboards to track progress, due dates, subtasks, assignees and more.",Cons: It can be a little bit intimidating at first. But once you get the hang of it Asana works flawlessly.
1037,1037 Asana,Asana,Marcel D.,Chief Innovation Officer,Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,9,“Favorite project management tool out there”,"Overall: Sometimes difficult for directors, but I guess that's what notifications are for, and tags, and reports.",31/12/2018,"Pros: The way how you can create lists and add sub-tasks, then add those to different projects, linking them together, collaboration is really on point here.","Cons: I wish there would be a better way to work between multiple ""workplaces"" sometimes having different teams for different departments can clutter up the side bar."
1038,1038 Asana,Asana,Eduardo L.,Corporate Procurement,Construction,2+ years,5,5,4,,,10,“Awesome and sexy app for task management”,"Overall: In my team, we have used Asana a couple of times and it works even better than Sharepoint for collaborative and task management. It's ease of use is great that we didn't even have to search for manuals or tutorial videos to start using it. The document attachments, the notes, due dates and how to add responsibles to different tasks is very friendly and everything you do from your computer is automatically updated on the tablet an phone apps. The reminder is sinchronized with your phone calendar, which is great to keep track of due dates when you're on the go.",12/12/2018,"Pros: The ease of use, the remainders, how the chat works, the task manager and the features available, all those works great and the mobile app from an iPad or an iPhone is great.",Cons: I really didn't find anything to dislike. The only issue is that is not easy to go with a stand alone solution for the entire organization. Usually the broader solutions are the official products for large companies.
1039,1039 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,4,9,“King of Project Management Apps”,Overall: Simple project management-we always know what's due next.,11/12/2018,"Pros: This product is beautifully designed, easy to use, and best of all-simple. It's progressed nicely in the last few years and now seems to be one of the best project management tools out there. I particularly like the high level view of projects as we manage a digital agency with lots of ongoing production.",Cons: Nothing to complain about. Can get costly with a big team but you get what you pay for. Certainly paying a premium for the brand.
1040,1040 Asana,Asana,rebecca h.,Content Developer,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Keeps us on track!”,Overall:,11/12/2018,"Pros: Dashboard is clean and uncomplicated, making it easy to see which tasks I have to complete, in priority order. It helps me to stay on deadline (and checking them off is so satisfying!) Assigning tasks to others assigned to my projects is quick and easy and I can include all relevant details, which saves me from writing an additional email to my team member.","Cons: An email is sent to me for each task added, which is annoying when an entire project is assigned task-by-task. I would prefer to receive a notification in the dashboard when tasks are added or modified."
1041,1041 Asana,Asana,Johan P.,Partner,Accounting,2+ years,4,4,4,,,7,“Good but not for everyone”,"Overall: This is great if you have a big projects with smaller departments inside. Think e.g a big conference, and you have tickets, logistics, security etc as subsections",8/12/2018,"Pros: I liked that it is easy to use, so staff can quickly learn It is quite flexible in the different views available, and the different ways projects could be setup and managed I like that it quickly picks up collegues using the same domain name email, for work allocation (even if they haven't opened an asana profile - yet) There is a lot of different integrators available to and from asana, which helps with the other software you use","Cons: All the flexibility also means that and organization's prfile could quickly become crowed and messy, especially is a clear structure is not kept from the start Project starting dates is a paid feauture If you manage a few teams and projects the notifications could become quite a lot"
1042,1042 Asana,Asana,Rick W.,Emotional Freedom Coach,Internet,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,8,"“I use it, and I wish it were better”","Overall: I have hundreds of tasks, business and personal, in the system. It helps be stay sane. I have recurring as well that take care of personal and business reminders, taxes, payments, etc. And... I do keep looking for something else.",14/11/2018,"Pros: For a to-do list and project and subtask oriented person like myself, it works better for me than card type systems like Trello.","Cons: They have some features in the paid version I would really like! But they only offer that to people with teams of 5+, and I am a team of 1. No way to get those features unless I overpaid."
1043,1043 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Accounting,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Saves My Life”,Overall: An absolute life saver,9/11/2018,Pros: I use all of the features available daily. The value is seen in the management of teams and projects. A life saver,"Cons: Some of my tasks contains a great deal of information. Some times, it is challenging when viewing the inbox to identify when one tasks finishes and another starts. While I understand that the information is visible in the inbox, updates can probably be restricted to a certain maximum length and you can access the respective task to view all details."
1044,1044 Asana,Asana,Helena W.,Marketing Coordinator (Freelance),Entertainment,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Asana is great for organization”,,25/10/2018,,"Cons: It's easy to accidentally mark something as done, and when you do it's gone. If you don't know which one you marked done that could pose as a problem. Maybe there is a way to figure out which one you marked. It goes to the email of the person who created the task, but if you didnt create it but were only assigned it, it might be a little annoying to have to go to the person to ask them which one you accidentally marked as done. They need to have an ""are you sure"" button."
1045,1045 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Awesome project and task management app!”,"Overall: It's a fantastic tool that pretty much lacks nothing. It has it all: design, features, simplicity, integrations. If you need something for planning and project managing, this is the tool to choose.",23/8/2018,"Pros: Let's start with Asana's design and user interface. It's just fantastic. Other tools for project and task management feel like they're stuck in around 2008. Asana is totally 2018 and I love it. Also, it's really fast, and it has plenty of features and integration with various services. Surprisingly, it's also easy to use","Cons: It doesn't have a desktop app, so we always have to use alternatives that are not as comfortable for our company. Despite that, I still really enjoy using Asana on daily basis."
1046,1046 Asana,Asana,Nataly O.,Chief Accountant,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,9,“This is an excellent tool for planning teamwork”,,23/8/2018,,"Cons: I, like the chief accountant, often need to involve several specialists in the performance of a task. For some reason, there is no such possibility in Asana. Of course, I can duplicate tasks, but I would like several people to work on the same task together."
1047,1047 Asana,Asana,Valeria T.,Software Developer,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,9,“Monitor your tasks and projects quickly!”,Overall: Excellent platform helped me to be more organized in my tasks,25/7/2018,"Pros: It is an excellent platform to coordinate teamwork, has incredible options, such as the ability to establish a schedule to set deadlines for the delivery of a project, a list of tasks and schedules, you can also monitor all the activities of your team to have all in time.","Cons: Maybe when you start using it, the interface will be a little different, to the other platforms, but the truth is that it is more intuitive, and the free version has some limitations and if your team is large, you must choose other plans that are paid, but the truth is that it is not very expensive, it is worth it since it is a great platform."
1048,1048 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Restaurants,2+ years,4,5,5,,,8,“Asana keeps everyone on the same page”,,24/7/2018,,Cons: The one downside about Asana is the difficulty in updating project docs or linking Asana to other systems aside from email or slack.
1049,1049 Asana,Asana,Diego G.,Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,3,5,5,10,“Really love the clean design and the straightforward scope of its project management features.”,Overall: Really helps me focus on what tasks are most important.,10/7/2018,"Pros: What I like most is how easy it is to do three things really fast. Create a task, assign it to someone, and set a due date. The three most important things any task should have and they let you do that really fast. I also really like their new Trello-like layout. Super helpful for Agile development.","Cons: Missing some key features in terms of prioritization/flags. Minor issue and there are ways to work around it, but it would be helpful to have."
1050,1050 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,11-50 employees,2+ years,5,5,5,3,5,10,“Asana is absolutely awesome... I use it for all my project management.”,,10/7/2018,,"Cons: The only thing I don't like about Asana is the simple fact that not enough people use it. Because of this, usually I need to convince my team members to create a new account with it and whenever I outsource a project there's a good chance I will need to use something other than Asana."
1051,1051 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,51-200 employees,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,9,“I work with Asana to share the progress of work with customers”,Overall: Asana helped me to organize better my team and to be transparent with my customers,9/4/2018,"Pros: An extremely creative layout, excellent task and subtask organization (attachments, follower per task, comments too), it is software that makes us feel that we are in full development of the age of sharing. Drag and drop everywere maximize ease of use and user experience. I really appreciate the pop ups that appear when you make mistakes (even if it does not work with all actions).","Cons: The free plan it's so restrective, too small test group and too little time to test the product, it's a pity to just try the basic dashboard; it costs too much per person (only medium-large companies can afford it). You can only undo the last action. It is difficult to configure all notifications. It takes a long time to understand all the features"
1052,1052 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“A great and easy to use project management Tool I used and use for many Projects”,Overall: I don't forget to dos and I can easily check up on the progress of my partners,20/3/2018,Pros: It is really easy to use and still has many nice features which allow you to also manage more complicated projects. So I use it is able to be used as a simple personal to do list as well as coordinate small companies.,"Cons: Puh, really hard to think about something negative... but one thing comes to mind - I guess the app could be better - I dont use the app very often but it seems to more a bit mor complicated than it would have to be I guess"
1053,1053 Asana,Asana,Shirley B.,Web-analyst,1-10 employees,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“I am pleased to recommend this service”,,17/2/2018,,"Cons: The only drawback of Asana is that the whole system and the documentation for it are presented only in English. Unfortunately, I do not speak this language perfectly, so I have to ask my colleagues for help from time to time."
1054,1054 Asana,Asana,Samantha S.,Marketing Programming Coordinator,201-500 employees,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Project and Task Management Made Easy”,"Overall: Everything that has to do with my projects is all in one place - due dates, notes, graphics, comments - nothing gets lost because you can just keep adding and updating to create a really helpful trail of work. If you're starting from scratch and trying to build out a complex system of project tracking, there can definitely be a bit of a learning curve to get started. That being said, once you have some time to poke around and get your feet wet, it all starts to become really simple and intuitive.",8/2/2018,"Pros: There's really no shortage of ways to organize your information in Asana. It's easy to make sections with tasks and subtasks, move it all around, and assign, tag, add dates, add notes, etc. - everything you need for a project is literally all in one place with Asana.",
1055,1055 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,3,4,4,8,“I love this!”,,2/2/2018,,Cons: The only drawback is file size - there's a 100MB limit which can be tricky when sharing print documentation with outside suppliers.
1056,1056 Asana,Asana,Caitlin L.,Content Manager,11-50 employees,2+ years,5,4,4,5,4,9,“Pretty Good. ”,Overall: The ability to integrate with Harvest for easy time tracking. The ability to have all projects located in one place. The new integration with Gmail has also improved the function for our office.,1/2/2018,Pros: I love the structure of the tasks and subtasks. The subtasks make it very easy to delegate projects out to multiple people and have them located in a central space. The projects and a shortcuts are usually pretty easy to figure out after a few months.,Cons: I get very frustrated when I have to drag and drop one task at a time into a new section. I have not found a way to move multiple tasks at once unless I drag them into a bigger task as subtasks one by one and then move that task which seems inefficient.

I would prefer to eliminate email altogether and simply get notifications on my desktop, like messages. The customer service hasn't been that great when helping me try to solve these small challenges."
1058,1058 Asana,Asana,James S.,Cto,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,8,“Asana is a tool that has worked well to mold to our changing processes. ”,Overall: Storage of company knowledge and accountability in our development process,5/9/2017,"Pros: The non opinionated nature of the software allows us to take a given process and represent it quite well within asana. The fact that as a small firm, we can get going on the platform without a large outlay of money is also very attractive.",Cons: Asana would be greatly enhanced by a scriptabl workflow engine where one could take a process and enforce constraints upon it. This would allow us to be able to model more of our business within the tool.
1059,1059 Asana,Asana,Valerio P.,Director,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,7,“Great tracking software”,"Overall: For us it was a big change when we started using Asana, before that we just drove by mail. By switching to Asana our productivity improved noticeably. From there, it was easier to control the tasks, assign tasks and know the status of the projects.",21/7/2017,Pros: This software allows you to track your development team in an easy and efficient way. Its web interface is intuitive and simple. Ideal for work teams that do not require much customization of their project tracking software.,"Cons: In our case, we needed to define complicated workflows for our development projects which we can not do with Asana. That was the main reason we stopped using it. However, in case you want to keep things simple, Asana is a great product."
1060,1060 Asana,Asana,Heber S.,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,3,4,9,“One of the best apps for managing tasks among teams.”,,10/7/2017,,"Cons: Chats are not clear at all when you try to fast read them, it would be better if it has a design similar to a chat conversation, with bubbles and the face of the person saying that. It can be cheaper, it's not very expensive, but if it gets cheaper it would become a massive used tool. It's very difficult to find a help chat on their page in case you have doubts."
1061,1061 Asana,Asana,David M.,Copywriter,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,5,4,5,5,9,“My main work planning tool”,"Overall: Asana has quickly become my go-to project planning tool. It's designed in a very user-friendly fashion, it never gets in the way of your getting your things done. I begin my workday, every day, by checking ""My Tasks"" and moving things around by priorities or deadlines and then getting to work on them right away. I make use of the very handy integration with Everhour to track my time and it's just seamless. I guess I'll be using Asana in the foreseeable future to plan both my freelance and full-time jobs. If I had to ask for any improvements these would be: try to make it a little faster and make it available as a desktop app. That'll be amazing",6/12/2016,"Pros: It's ease of use, excellent user interface and overall project-planning features.",Cons: Sometimes it feels slow. No desktop app available.
1062,1062 Asana,Asana,Dave P.,Environmental Manager,Automotive,2+ years,4,3,5,5,4,8,“Outstanding desktop collaboration app”,"Overall: Asana is one of, if not the, best collaborative work/project apps I've used, and I've tried many. There is a little bit of a learning curve to get into ALL the features, but it's worth it because they are powerful. They are continually adding features and involve their users in new feature requests and testing. The mobile app has gotten quite good (it used to lag the desktop/web version and competitors' apps). If I could wish for one thing, it would be push reminders to the mobile app for dates/times and location.",6/12/2016,Pros: powerful features like multi-homing tasks and excellent privacy controls,"Cons: can be clunky, too much going on with all 3 panes"
1063,1063 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,4,4,,,“Aaana”,Overall: Aaana helps us manage multiple campaigns. The app is extremely useful in sending us instant updates of task added. There best part about Asana is the calendar view which has helped me to visually analyze the amount of work pending and how to manage it within the speculated time. Reminders help us to stay on our toe and the in app messaging and commenting feature makes your life a while lot easy.,17/11/2016,"Pros: The easy to use UI which makes the app Appealing. Also, the calendar view that helps make task management simple.",Cons: Assigning a task is bit drag. The lack of bots that's available in most apps now is a big drawback.
1064,1064 Asana,Asana,Claire C.,Project Management Supervisor,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,3,3,4,9,“For Agency Use”,"Overall: Asana is a great tool for our agency work flow. I think overall the platform is easy to adopt for new users. A couple feature I would like to see added, is if you could assign more than one person to a task that would be helpful to our workflow. Also, if there was a way to show a teams' ""weekly tasks"" in one view instead of having to click on each individual team member, and also if we can assign time to a task (like how long a task should take"" to create a schedule that way you can easily see if a person's day is too full and then divvy tasks up to even out the workload, as a PM/traffic manager, it would just lessen the number of things I have to keep track of.",3/11/2016,,
1065,1065 Asana,Asana,Lee B.,Bakery Associate,Retail,2+ years,4,3,4,4,5,7,“Awesome if you can handle the learning curve”,"Overall: When I first discovered Asana I was thrilled. I was able to put every single bit of information in one place, complete with tagging team members who needed to do things, providing checklists and deadlines, attaching files, you name it. The more I explored it, the more I discovered how awesome it was. And then I brought my team in and tried to use it with them...and it just didn't happen. They were intimidated by the number of features and never took the time to learn the program, so instead they avoided it as much as possible. Were it more readily learned or were I to have a team more interested in learning new programs, it would have been an incredible tool. However, because of it's complexity, it ended up next to useless.",19/7/2016,"Pros: Tagging, discussions, deadlines, multiple ways of sorting information, excellent searching","Cons: Learning curve, no private messaging, bulky mobile app"
1066,1066 Asana,Asana,Jeanette D.,Product Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,,7,“Asana can be great if you have org buy-in”,,15/6/2015,,"Cons: I'm going to have to be a jerk and say that what I like best, is also what I like least. The fact that it's so fluid, makes it hard to get everyone on the same page. People within my own department all had their own way of using Asana. Since it was never ""forced"" upon the entire organization, this left a very disjointed experience. When you combine a whole bunch of unique Asana instances, and then introduce the concept of assigning tasks, your ""to-do list"" becomes crazy and hard to follow."
1067,1067 Asana,Asana,Kalu A.,Financial Manager,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,4,4,3,,,6,“Asana is a decent platform for project management”,"Overall: For managing day to day, month to month, year to year tasks for yourself alone, then yes - this is a good program to you. I think Asana has a long way to go in order to be the leader in project management software. There are many ways this program can improve to be more user friendly, more strategic, and more organizational. With a few more improvements, it will definitely get the extra boost.",9/11/2020,"Pros: What I liked most about this software is that it's easy to use as a single person managing tasks. I also like the that you can customize the background. Another very important feature that other softwares dont have is genuine RECURRING tasks, i.e. ""Repeat every ## of weeks"".","Cons: What I like least is that when working on a team, it's not that great. Asana is also not very ""pretty"". Our team had issues implementing it because it didn't feel too user friendly for a whole team."
1068,1068 Asana,Asana,ashley n.,Director of Operations,Health,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Amazing for team task management”,"Overall: Asana makes everything so much easier, we have always been remote and asana is one of our main tools ofr staying organized, I would be lost without it.",8/10/2020,"Pros: Asana makes it so easy to collaborate on projects and tasks and is the best I have seen in my career for assigning tasks and ease of use, especially for a fully remote team.","Cons: The only item I find hard is sometimes the grouping by groups/etc makes it hard when removing a user, I seem to have to be able to make sure they are removed from every project."
1069,1069 Asana,Asana,Gerard H.,Business Development Manager,Management Consulting,2+ years,5,4,5,,3,8,“A slick and intuitive collaboration tool”,"Overall: Asana's slick design and useable interface really appealed to me, and used properly it's a really powerful productivity tool for managing personal and team tasks.",6/10/2020,"Pros: Although Asana specializes in workflow management, I have found it to handle task management very well too. It's very flexible and you can configure it easily to how you want to work. Our team benefited greatly from using Asana's collaboration tools; especially useful to us is how it prevents things slipping through the cracks - you can easily see who is responsible for what next task or action. We found the workload tool especially useful in balancing our team's tasks, too - some were unfairly loaded and Asana helped us distribute the work more sustainably.","Cons: Slightly intimidating and confusing at first when setting up, although it is worth the effort invested up front. And although it's priced on the higher end, it doesn't really have full project management tools that you might expect at this cost."
1070,1070 Asana,Asana,Henrique K.,Journalist,Media Production,2+ years,4,3,4,3,3,7,“Excellent but far from perfect”,"Overall: After having tested several similar alternatives, I decided that Asana offered the best cost-benefit ratio.",28/9/2020,"Pros: Flexibility is Asana's main asset. Also, the free plan is quite generous, which might be a deal breaker for individuals who work on independent projects, like freelance professionals for instance.","Cons: The learning curve might be quite steep. If you're not willing to spend some time to learn how to use Asana, your overall experience will probably be a frustrating one."
1071,1071 Asana,Asana,Federico J.,Founder and Senior Copywriter,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,5,3,5,8,“I've loved Asana for years but I now see its shortcomings”,,31/7/2020,,"Cons: It's not that I don't like it, but recently I've started documenting processes for my business to try and make my work more repeatable and predictable. Unfortunaltey, Asana is not built for this kind of businesses. It's great if each new project you have looks different or unique. But when you try to scale up and run your business with recurring tasks, Asana fails. There's no easy way to templatize projects, assignees, due dates. You can use workarounds but it's not built from the core to handle this kind of work so you eventually have to adapt to it, not the other way around."
1072,1072 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Industrial Automation,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Get more productive with Asana”,Overall: It's been great so far. Definitely a breath of fresh air when it comes to task management.,31/7/2020,"Pros: We have adapted Asana in order to increase accountability and productivity within our teams. Using this program, we are able to track the different stages of the project's life cycle as well as who has done what.","Cons: You need to be careful. If you sync the notifications of Asana with your email, it's going to be flooded. Also, it's easy to get lost once you've been made a follower on so many tasks."
1073,1073 Asana,Asana,Elizabeth W.,Administrative Aide,Broadcast Media,2+ years,4,5,5,5,5,8,“Its a great cloud based application with very effective collaborations on projects. ”,"Overall: With Asana, we have been able to improve in the productivity of our projects because we are able to see how far a particular person is with a particular task where we are able to plan for our future projects easily. We have been able to collaborate more leading to more improvement in our general perfomances.",25/6/2020,Pros: You can create a task as a part of the big project and be able to assign then to specific members and provide them with a deadline. Asana is suitable for both long term and short term projects where the completed projects can be archived for future references. It offers a simple and nice platform for project management.,Cons: Asana has very poor exporting features.
1074,1074 Asana,Asana,Jeremie R.,Digital,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,3,4,3,6,“Good Project management solution for teams”,"Overall: If you are looking for a comprehensive project management tool for teams, asana is one of the best",25/6/2020,"Pros: Easy to setup, and to get your team onboard, and helps in managing projects in an efficient way especially if you are working remotely","Cons: Their free plan is good enough to start with for teams, but not enough to fully use features for long term projects like gantt charts"
1075,1075 Asana,Asana,Chris K.,Marketing and Business Development Manager,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,4,4,4,4,9,“Great software for working with remotely-located teams”,Overall: Asana has been a great tool that has allowed my global team to work together on a multitude of projects across many time zones.,19/6/2020,"Pros: The dashboard is the thing that I find the most helpful since it allows me to have an instant overview of all of the projects that are on-going across the organization, even outside of my own team.",Cons: I wish it would be easier to have several windows open at once when it comes to creating tasks. Some of the noticies could be easier to understand by offering a cleaner UI.
1076,1076 Asana,Asana,Sophia G.,Consultant,Insurance,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“Fantastic program for collaboration and productivity tracking with project management capabilities”,Overall: This is a fantastic program. Very versatile. It excels at task management. Easy to use.,24/4/2020,"Pros: Asana is a great tool to use when collaborating on a project. Its main focus collaboration and productivity. It does have project management capabilities but they are much more restrictive than collaboration and productivity tools. It is Free for up to 15 users with not many limitations for the free version. However, if you buy the premium or business version, it is billed annually per user and you get access to more options such as timeline viewer, customizable dashboards, custom forms and fields, milestones, and for managers an admin control panel.","Cons: It doesn't have document editing, time tracking or live chat but there are many other program integrations to get this done."
1077,1077 Asana,Asana,Chris E.,Consultant,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Stay Organized the way you like too!”,Overall: I use Asana for pretty much managing all of my businesses. From onboarding to support to business planing and employee training.,3/4/2020,"Pros: It's flexible. You don't have to do things their way. If it's a to do list it's a to do list. If you want to use it for CRM you can build your own CRM. If you want to use it for PM, set it up the way that fits best with your business.",Cons: I wish some of the features didn't require a paid plan. And I wish they used a better pricing structure then per user.
1078,1078 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Sports,2+ years,4,5,4,,,9,“Third product implementation is the charm!”,,9/1/2020,,"Cons: One feature I wish Asana contained is a chat feature. However you can add questions and comments in the ""Detail"" section of a task. Also, wish there was an alert feature that shared any and all tasks that have been modified or questions/comments have been added."
1079,1079 Asana,Asana,Ashley B.,Owner,Retail,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Asana is Awesome”,"Overall: The communication between members is so great! I'm obsessed with checking off boxes, so I love to see that line of a project being crossed off the list",9/12/2019,"Pros: I love how easy it is to streamline projects, goals, etc. between a whole team of people. I also love how easy it is to upload items from your phone right onto the app.","Cons: For me personally, I don't like to follow some people's progress on projects that don't involve me. But, I totally understand why that's helpful. There really isn't anything else that I can think of at the moment as far as things I don't like."
1080,1080 Asana,Asana,Scott G.,President,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Use for work and personal use - LOVE IT!”,Overall: Asana has been my go-to task software for over 7 years. The crazy part is they pretty much got it right the first time and everything functions almost the same as it did at the begins. Would highly recommend.,7/12/2019,Pros: I love how simple the features are. It is very innate and natural to use. The simplicity of it all keeps me coming back to use it.,Cons: Sometimes I wish the templates were easier to make them reocurring. It makes it for the days to be followed up more easily instead of having to manually input them in all the time.
1081,1081 Asana,Asana,Charlotte s.,Senior account manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Great task management for cross team collaboration”,Overall:,3/12/2019,Pros: - Frequently adding to the ways in which you can view tasks i.e. timeline etc. - Good collaboration and owndership management with the ability to add people to tasks and track progress and edits,Cons: - Improved real-time functionality - While there are a lot of integration options more CRM options would be great especially for a SaaS business where engineering tasks may be directly related to a deal
1082,1082 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Internet,2+ years,5,3,3,4,4,8,“Needs more integration automatization”,Overall: We could make our team more active and with a better response rate about our roadmap.,3/12/2019,Pros:,"Cons: The gantt should be released to all users, not just for paid users."
1083,1083 Asana,Asana,Brett R.,"Analyst, Information Systems",Consumer Goods,2+ years,4,4,5,,5,8,“Great Free Option”,Overall:,30/11/2019,"Pros: The biggest draw is the low price (free.) it has many features of similar project management tasks, but it's easier to replicate. We use Asana to manage our local branch of an employee resource group within our company. All the tasks can be grouped for an event (fundraiser, conference, recruiting event, etc) along with supply lists and budgets, then replicated for the following year.","Cons: I wouldn't say it's as intuitive as the more tile based alternatives, so we've had to implement some training sessions for our event chairs and/other members who are first time users."
1084,1084 Asana,Asana,Jose Asdrubal M.,Sales/Marketing Team,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Best management system”,"Overall: In these years that I have used this app, it has greatly facilitated the work in the company and has given efficiency to the projects in the company.",5/11/2019,"Pros: This app is by far one of the best task management platforms for work teams that I have used. It allows you to create, manage, assign, interact tasks easily, and it is also very practical to follow up on the work done.",Cons: When there are many tasks assigned to different users in the same workspace it is sometimes difficult to organize it.
1085,1085 Asana,Asana,Karen F.,Consultant,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,“Great PM Tool!”,Overall: I manage projects with Asana and keep my clients informed where we are with weekly summaries and,24/10/2019,"Pros: Organize Tasks, assign to users, maintain timeline and status. And it integrates with Teams and Salesforce.",Cons: The software does not allow to assign tasks to multiple users. It is not a big issue but it would help.
1086,1086 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,5,4,5,4,9,“Easier than Wrike”,"Overall: Very easy, friendly, and well thought out. Wrike appears more like a commercial heavy-weight, for us easier is better.",22/10/2019,"Pros: That it has a non-profit pricing. Wrike cancelled that, so we switched to Asana. And the custom fields come in Asana in the cheaper package, with Wrike you had to go one tier higher.","Cons: Lack of nested folders. Everything is a project - and before you know, you have lots of them, and no way to group them topically (yes, you can use teams, but that's more focused towards sharing with different people)."
1087,1087 Asana,Asana,Harshad P.,Web Designer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,4,,,10,“A Prefect Tool For Project Mamagement”,Overall: Using asana since last 4 years and i dont find any issue with this. i am web designer and my all task and projects are easily managed by asana. It save my lots of time.,9/10/2019,Pros: Asana is Prefect Platform to track and manage your project. you can easily assing work to your other team members and also track there status of work.,"Cons: I dont find any drawbacks in asana atlest for my work, its totally 100% working for me and everything is perfect as per my needs, i am managing my web design tasks on that."
1088,1088 Asana,Asana,Etiana G.,Communications Coordinator,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Love Asana!”,Overall: I love it. My entire communications team has used it for at least 3 years. There's a different layout for all types of personalities and project management.,30/9/2019,Pros:  Easy to use Everyone can access it from their phones or any computer Checklist feature when tasks are complete Calendar style viewing Group messaging is easy to use I've had other companies use it to share project updates and files. Love Love Love,"Cons:  This isn't much of a con, but there are so many awesome features that it can be overwhelming at first. It's been so long since I was a beginner at Asana, but it would be nice if there was a complete walkthrough of what Asana is capable of."
1089,1089 Asana,Asana,Austin S.,SEM Manager,Health,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Asana - Perfect User Accessibility”,,22/8/2019,,Cons: I honestly cannot think of another software besides maybe Google Calendar that compares. There's no real advantage to either but Asana just makes it easy overall to do what you need to be done without overthinking it at all.
1090,1090 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,“Social Media Content Calendar Usage”,Overall: I recommend Asana all the time to teams and people who need an easy-to-use project management tool. Our team runs on Asana,22/8/2019,"Pros: Our team uses Asana as a content calendar for social media. We have numerous pages and accounts, so Asana helps keep us organized and tracking together as a team. I love the calendar view because it lets us see, at a glace, what's going out where and when.",Cons: Asana has experienced some technical failures since our team began using it and it's very frustrating on the user end.
1091,1091 Asana,Asana,Tanisha S.,Virtual Assistant,Staffing and Recruiting,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“Awesome Task Management Assistance”,"Overall: I love it, I can manage my tasks much more efficiently",1/8/2019,"Pros: I love the ease of use, I can manage all tasks created for myself and others. I love the platforms appearance as well as the assistance offered to keep myself up to date with new features rolled out.","Cons: No complaints, I love everything about using Asana!"
1092,1092 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Retail,2+ years,4,4,4,,,10,“Loving Asana!”,"Overall: For routine tasks that happen bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly or annually, it's brilliant. Game changer.",29/5/2019,"Pros: So I've been trying to get into the Asana groove for over a year, and it just didn't really click until about two months ago. I was previously using it just for project mgmt, and frankly, think Excel is just as good for the small projects I work on usually. However, I recently saw how a peer used it for task oversight / mgmt for his team. Brilliant! I now use it with my direct report for just about everything that she's working on. If I need to jump in and handle something, then I'll check the task off, otherwise, I know exactly what is getting done when and that we won't miss any steps.","Cons: It's taken a long time for me to get into a rhythm with it. I'm on a small team, and we are the only ones using it. It's just not quite intuitive enough for me to make it easy from a sharing perspective. Easy enough for me as an individual user, but the power is in the sharing."
1093,1093 Asana,Asana,Francesca B.,Customer Marketing Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Asana enables work to happen faster”,,28/5/2019,,"Cons: Honestly, not a whole lot. At this point, I can't think of any improvements outside of maybe a color picker to assign colors outside of the standard options they currently provide."
1094,1094 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Great tool for task management”,"Overall: We use Asana for marketing tasks management. We use different boards for different teams and projects and deploy tasks + subtasks structure to operate efficiently. Setup was super easy, it takes minutes to get people there and have them start using it. Reminders on our own tasks keep ppl in check of work across multiple projects.",8/5/2019,"Pros: - I can easily create complex project boards, split up the tasks into subprojects and assign to different people - Super easy to use, works fast - A robust functionality of drag and drop - anything to anywhere - Helps us be more efficient every day - Reminders and personal timeline is very helpful to never miss out on stuff.","Cons: - Expensive for what it does for us - We use Trello for other teams, does similar things, but cheaper - Inability to create multiple checklists in one task, super big drag for us"
1095,1095 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Online Media,2+ years,4,4,4,,4,7,"“Good, but...”","Overall: I'm generally satisfied with the free version but like I said, I'm probably only using a fraction of the available features. It's hard enough to keep track of all my tasks as is! :) I haven't got around to learning the nuances of the software.",9/4/2019,Pros: It is a must for startups and smaller companies without enterprise software suites. Gotta keep track of those tasks and delegate them somehow! :) Gmail integration is great: you can create a task from an email,"Cons: I have been using it for 8 months and I'm probably only using a very small part of the features, although we did not upgrade to premium. The most useful features are in the Premium version (I'm not holding that against them). The feature I would really need is the ""timeline"" function but I'm hesitant to pay 4 bucks a month for that feature alone (since I'm not using a great deal of them)."
1096,1096 Asana,Asana,Robert N.,Administrator,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,4,3,4,4,3,7,“A Fairly Good Product”,Overall: This product allowed for the Doctor and I to have better communication with our various projects. It forced us to make notes and get things accomplished. Very useful once you know the product well.,25/2/2019,Pros: This product really got me coordinated with my various projects and timelines. I has a variety of useful features that allow for instant tracking of jobs and other items that need to be completed,Cons: The learning curve can be steep. The basic functions work well but the further you go it does get more complex.
1097,1097 Asana,Asana,Gabrielle A.,Student,Research,2+ years,4,3,4,,,7,"“Flexible, Fast and Favored. ”",Overall: Asana is great to use to use for project management - its encouraging to track progress and see completed tasks.,17/2/2019,"Pros: This is a great tool for teamwork. As a student, I often find myself having to work in a group for assignments. Given this, I never need more than the free version that allows up to 15 members. I do not necessarily need the timeline function (which is not offered in the version that I use), because we generally have to be on top of our assignments and most are not long term. I really appreciate that Asana tracks a team member's progress and tasks because this encourages people to complete their tasks because they know that their input is transparent. Asana has a fairly user-friendly interface - most tech savvy youngsters can figure out how to navigate and use it effectively. I like that I can link it to my Google account. Recently, Asana has been my first suggestion for group work.","Cons: Luckily, as students, we are mostly connected to campus wifi. However, I have noticed that Asana does not function when not connected. This can be frustrating at times. Being an intuitive tool, it is not an option for use between myself and my academic advisers because they would not be willing to learn how to use Asana when there are simpler other options. I have to add deadlines on tasks so that these tasks do not become overlooked. Deadlines, although often necessary, are not always needed. It would be really great to communicate with team members within the app - perhaps through an instant messenger? Without this feature, sometimes responsibilities get lost in communication given that its not all on the platform."
1098,1098 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Human Resources,2+ years,4,5,4,,4,9,“Task tracking/ Project management made easy!”,,12/2/2019,,Cons: I think the tool can be more simplified in terms of templates that are there for projects etc. A scrum functionality (like Trello) is currently missing.

1100,1100 Asana,Asana,Steve W.,TriNova Brand Manager,Automotive,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,"“If you're into project management software, Asana should do the trick”","Overall: Asana has been great. We use it to manage our content calendar, product development process, and strategic initiatives by SKU. The visibility into what other members of the team are working on is outstanding and it's been a help to our brand.",5/2/2019,Pros: I am a timeline man - so seeing my little tasks and jobs organized by stage and then cascade into the next stage is satisfying and helpful. I think you can organize projects in other ways BUT WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO!? Assigning tasks and making things dependent on prior work getting completed is intuitive and absolutely streamlines our processes.,"Cons: There is almost too much functionality in places. I almost didn't get started because it seems like there's too much going on and it seemed overwhelming. I'll stick to post-it notes, I thought. I'm glad I didn't - just know that you can customize as much or as little as you like!"

Asana has a template function and we recreate the projects and thus update the tasks as we need them. Since the arrival of Asana we managed to improve the ROI in a good and high percentage (Everything has generated great positive results)","Cons: Asana is very visual and super easy to use, you can also access several users at once without waiting for someone to leave a project to add something. Honestly the best of Asana is how incredibly fast we managed to increase our ROI."

The price is correct, and after a small adjustment, remote work will become more efficient.",23/1/2019,"Pros: Lots of features in free version, different layouts for organize information. Creating tasks, check schedule and reassign things are incredible easy.",Cons: Need to improve their features for real time conversations between the team. Most of time we ended up in Slack o Hangouts. I'd also like a built in time tracker (instead using a plugin for connect with another service)

It is difficult to track the status of the task when not assigned to you.

CSMO.,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,5,,4,8,"“Some one Likes Jira, but Asana is what You need!”",,14/12/2018,,"Cons: Someone can say it is not clear in some details or features. Then I ask, my Dear, don't You think it is really good to read a guide first)))) So nothing bad about Asana. Try it and it will not let You down."

Also, the flexibility that allows you to switch to one template to another and the design of everything.","Cons: Nothing remarkable as the apps are also really well designed. Probably, some more integrations with voice and camera would be very nice."

Also the insight into the efficiency of the team and where our efforts are being spent the most.,8/12/2018,Pros: The power that Asana gives you is incredible. I have created a project for my team with custom fields. We mark each activity with these fields so that at the end of a quarter or year we can review and see where the majority of our effort was spent. This gives us fantastic insight into my teams efficiency.,"Cons: It does have a slight learning curve. With how powerful the software is, it's to be expected. Once you realize you can create custom fields and sections it opens a world of possibilities."

Asana allowed me to create exactly what I needed for me, and then for my team, and then other projects that we were running. I've continued to use Asana as my daily checklist and project organizer and share access with my manager so if they're every curious they can see exactly what I've been up to.","Cons: I haven't been able to convince my company to upgrade to the paid edition, so the calendar features are very limited, that's something I would really like."
1110,1110 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Higher Education,2+ years,5,5,4,5,,10,“Everything I need to manage tasks for our team”,,4/12/2018,,"Cons: For team members who use the software a bit less often we often have issues with their sign-in. Some alternative sign-in options would be useful. There are occasions where assigning multiple persons, or perhaps a group of people (team/collaborators) to a task would be useful, especially when the task as sub-tasks that are assigned to just one person."
1111,1111 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,4,,,9,“Tasks Made easy”,"Overall: it has been great so far, and made keep tracking of task and projects for my IT team a whole lot easier",29/11/2018,"Pros: It makes managing task and goals so much easier for the team im on, the email reminders are very helpful as well, it also lets us work better as a team and put out projects that need to be worked on so we have them all in one easy to find and use place, also nice that its on mobile as well so can check from anywhere",Cons: make new tasks or project could be a little easier to set up.
1112,1112 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Publishing,2+ years,4,3,4,4,4,7,“Good for project management but a bit confusing”,Overall: We were using Trello and overall Asana seems to serve the same functions but with more advanced capabilities.,28/11/2018,"Pros: This is a great way for organizing project management, including for managing an editorial calendar in publishing. Helps keep all team members on track with deadlines, including by sending automated emails when tasks are due. It also allows tasks to be reassigned to other users at various stages of the project. Overall it improves communication among a team and makes it easier to ensure that complex projects with multiple users and stages of development make it to successful completion without getting lost or overlooked.","Cons: It's a little bit confusing to learn, especially for third-party integrations. It's easier for administrators than users in my experience."
1113,1113 Asana,Asana,Shawn Z.,Founder,Health,2+ years,4,5,4,,5,7,“A good project management solution for small teams”,,21/11/2018,,"Cons: I've been with Asana for a while, and growing with them was a challenge at times because the interface would change a bit, or as improvements would be released it took more learning to implement the changes (even if they were good). So just some of the growing pains I guess were tough."
1114,1114 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Executive Office,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,10,“Can't live without it!”,"Overall: It keeps me together, it help me keep my clients in check and communication is so much cleaner when you communicate through the app rather than email. I seriously don't know what I did without it.",16/11/2018,Pros: I am a Virtual Assistant and work with multiple clients daily. I use the free version and frankly I haven't yet come across a reason to upgrade to the Pro Version. Sorry guys but you're just to darn good,Cons: I'd like to have access to the gant chart but meh... I'm living fine without having to pay for it.
1115,1115 Asana,Asana,Dave C.,Director,Design,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,9,“Simple to use & Flexible Project Management Software”,Overall: Great experience. Product is intuitive and easy to figure out.,13/11/2018,"Pros: Asana is a robust project management app with lots of features. I appreciate that you can can quickly switch from List view to Kanban to Timeline. My favorite feature is the""My Tasks"" section which allows you to easily plan your day. As you schedule tasks they will automatically populate this section as the their due date arrives.","Cons: The pricing. I love that Asana can scale from a one-man operation to a enterprise level company, but I wish they would allow you to purchase a single premium account instead of the 5 seat minimum that is currently in place."
1116,1116 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Excellent planning system!”,,13/11/2018,,Cons: Not being able to assign the same task to several people can be irritating. You can assign it to a group but it gets messy and becomes more work. The chat feature doesn't work well unless you are logged in Asana so its hard to get someones attention to see it.
1117,1117 Asana,Asana,Lisa R.,Senior Director Of Marketing,Higher Education,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,8,“Asana has Paid for Itself Time and Time Again”,"Overall: We utilize Asana as a marketing team to receive internal and external project requests, track approvals, store assets and manage timing on projects.",9/10/2018,Pros: We needed a software that was easy for not only our functional team to use in tracking projects - but also allowed compliance the ability to track revisions and approve/request changes prior to production. We have been able to integrate our Wufoo forms with Asana to create a nose to tail user expereince.,Cons: It is a bit clunky figuring out the difference between a task and a project - but once you really let everyone try it - and then figure out everyone's needs it is pretty easy to adapt.
1118,1118 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Management Consulting,2+ years,5,4,3,5,,8,“Easy and handy for managing your task!”,Overall: I have been using this for past 2 and half years and recommend everyone in my organization to use it. It makes our daily task assignment and follow up pretty easy especially when its a startup kind of an enviornment,20/9/2018,"Pros: -Its easy to use and App provides more flexibility -I like the tagging bit as it helps me arrange my task -Very detailed way of managing and assigning the task -quick to review and change, not much steps involved","Cons: When you have lots of items, it gets cluttered. Need a way to handle that"
1119,1119 Asana,Asana,Ricky F.,Executive Pastor,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Smashing the task list with Asana!”,Overall: We are having less meetings to fulfil the daily tasks in our organisation. Everyone is aware of what their colleagues are busy with and it is also a lot of fun,18/9/2018,Pros: Asana allows for a very effective environment to process many tasks. We have many departments in our organisation and most of the tasks require collaboration amongst employees. We are able to manage these tasks in a virtual environment online & don't need to always meet in the boardroom.,Cons: To be honest ... there is not much to dislike.
1120,1120 Asana,Asana,Sumit M.,Director,Biotechnology,2+ years,5,4,4,,4,8,“Asana reviews”,,6/9/2018,,Cons: Not many. The only thing my team got annoyed was the barrage of emails everyday regarding the task dues dates and assignments.
1121,1121 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Consumer Services,2+ years,5,4,4,,,9,“Super helpful organizing tool”,,4/9/2018,,"Cons: It has a lot of functionality, but it is not all super intuitive of how to find or use it"
1122,1122 Asana,Asana,Grant P.,Technology Manager,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,4,4,3,5,8,“PM Tool That Has Most of What I Want”,"Overall: My team uses Asana almost exclusively for project management. We have a variety of projects, but mainly use projects as buckets to create tasks. While I am sure I am not using the system 100% as the Asana team anticipates that users should, I feel this best meets the needs of my team.",30/8/2018,"Pros: Very easy to use, to assign tasks, to project manage.",Cons: I wish it was more fleshed out. The fact that you have to use 3rd-party tools for a lot of the functions of the app is kind of annoying. I also hate that subtasks don't integrate very well into tasks.
1123,1123 Asana,Asana,Christina Ferrara E.,Yoga Instructor,Health,2+ years,4,5,4,,,9,“Easy To Learn and Use”,"Overall: Although this software was used with a very small management team, I liked that I could easily see when a new task was added or when my supervisor (or myself) marked a task as ""completed"" so we could not only see what was left to do but see how much we've done.",15/8/2018,"Pros: The reminder emails when projects are due. It makes it simple and clear to see the tasks completed and tasks remaining, and eliminates the need to have to email team members to question where they are at in a project or task. It's an easy program to use with lots of tools to make planning efficient.","Cons: I have had only a positive experience with Asana, and have not had to contact customer services for any issues."
1124,1124 Asana,Asana,Samuel O.,Communications Designer,Internet,2+ years,5,4,5,4,,,“I have been a user of asana since 2016 and it is the best project management tool out there .”,,16/7/2018,,"Cons: I guess the only thing im on the fence was with the new update, my task/messages is hidden in a side nav that you have open to view, it kinda adds an extra step to it, but not like a huge deal breaker."
1125,1125 Asana,Asana,Franco N.,Med student,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,5,3,5,4,5,10,“Best software for tasking organization”,"Overall: A better comunication with the people i work, also i begin to use it in my entrepreneur business",14/7/2018,"Pros: Franco: Asana is a task manager with unique features within the same style software. Integrate the tasks of your work group in a same place, besides that it allows to see the progress of them. It also allows you to reorder your tasks according to the criteria you choose (date, project, etc.). The best part of the software that differentiates it from others in the market is that it allows you to add new tasks without having to start a new project, it also allows you to add tasks, see conversations and project from anywhere, even allowing you to add an extension to the browser to add tasks outside of Asana.","Cons: Franco: The learning process to handle Asana can be a bit cumbersome and tends to be a bit confusing because of the many functions that Asana brings. From the first moment it can be a bit difficult to find a good work flow. Another element that can be complicated is the function of shortcuts, learning them all can take some time. Another thing that I find uncomfortable is that you can not change the type of project once created."
1126,1126 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,4,10,“Fantastic Project Management Tool”,"Overall: We were able to connect a segmented team of remote workers, developers and consultants in a single, easy to use tool. We eliminated emailing about tasks and using the system to handle our task related communication.",19/6/2018,"Pros: I really enjoy the ease of use. This is a very easy product to use when training folks that typically don't use technology. From a feature standpoint, I really like the subtasks and custom fields. This allows you to have a hierarchy of tasks and make groupings. The custom fields allow you to make reporting based on additional data. Lastly, the integration with Instagantt is very helpful. This allows us to visually display our project timelines with customers.","Cons: Be cautious with the email notifications. You can easily turn them off, but you don't want folks ignoring these important emails and learning to dislike the system."
1127,1127 Asana,Asana,Vernita K.,Owner,Design,2+ years,5,3,4,5,5,10,“Asana has changed how I do business. I can be clear and concise regarding expectations and timeline.”,Overall: It saves a huge amount of time reading emails and answering questions from clients.,6/6/2018,"Pros: Asana has changed how I do business. I can be clear and concise regarding expectations and timeline. The client knows exactly when to expect what and when and what I expect from them. I have fewer emails in my inbox as communication happens via Asana. Clients can email comments and questions to Asana, so no lost emails, text messages or voice notes. Clients can track a project which means they bother me less. Clients get reminders about outstanding tasks which means less for me to do. I can set a due date for each task which holds both me and the client accountable. I can upload images to Asana for clients to review. I can copy a project so that I don't need to start each new project from scratch.",Cons: I wish there was a setting so that clients can't make changes to tasks or change due dates. It would be better if I could change the email notification settings of clients myself. This way they won't be bothered at the beginning of the project when everything is being set up. The search function could be better.
1128,1128 Asana,Asana,Chad L.,Deputy Fire Marshal,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,4,4,10,“We luckily introduced to Asana by a business partner to manage a software development project. ”,Overall: All parties are able to see the current status of the project. It keeps everyone on track and on task.,15/5/2018,"Pros: Asana has increased our efficiency by providing for multi-faceted project management. Elements can be assigned to various groups or individuals, tagged with a current status and re-assigned as needed until completed. It provides a user interface that is customizable and allows you to view project task assignments by project or by who it is assigned to. Asana has revolutionized how we manage projects.",Cons: Asana comes with a free app on Apple ITunes. It works well but would be better if it duplicated the user interface of the web application.
1129,1129 Asana,Asana,Michael S.,Senior Graphic Designer,1001-5000 employees,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,9,“Seamless & very straightforward”,Overall: Organized my chaos,7/5/2018,"Pros: Very easy to organize by projects, dates and more. Can keep track of 1 project with subtasks and even see your tasks via calendar.","Cons: Whenever it is updated, a task will send multiple emails and it can get annoying when there are multiple files being uploaded, you will be notified about every single one. Same with comments. Could be changed so that any amount of comments made in a specific amount of time (ie 5 mins) will be sent as 1 email notification."
1130,1130 Asana,Asana,Elmo L.,Business Management Executive,Management Consulting,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“Task management made easy and simple”,Overall: Easy task management with the ability to track time via a Harvest time integration.,1/5/2018,"Pros: It is very easy to add, assign and work on tasks. With one click we can see the tasks per project, per team member and we can track time per task with the Harvest Time integration.","Cons: For our use there are not a lot of cons, the task manager does all that we require. The one thing that I would like to change is the ability for team members to delete tasks. I think only an administrator should be able to delete tasks."
1131,1131 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,4,,5,9,“Great way to stay organized with multiple team members”,Overall: Easy to use from the start,19/1/2018,"Pros: This tool is very simple to use right from the start because the user interface is intuitive. I like having the flexibility to change the way I view tasks, which differs from how others on my team like to view their dashboard. The additional features of attaching files and creating custom project stages are bonuses. And most of all, I love the flying narwhal reward when I check off tasks! A lighthearted and fun reward system built in.",Cons: There are times when the tool doesn't give us a deeper level of flexibility (such as date and time stamps for comments) that we wish we had.
1132,1132 Asana,Asana,Erick K.,Marketing Director,Automotive,2+ years,4,4,5,4,5,10,“I use Asana daily to organize my team's projects. After testing multiple tools Asana is easiest”,"Overall: Time savings, organization, project management from anywhere",9/1/2018,Pros: Cross-device functionality makes it easy to keep things updated regardless of where I am. Easily search for past projects and files. Assigning tasks to my team is quick and receiving alerts on my phone when they are completed or responded to is very helpful.,Cons: Setting up project template workflows could be easier with more options and flexibility. Sometimes it requires me to have to log back in for no reason
1133,1133 Asana,Asana,Talmage E.,Digital Marketing Specialist,11-50 employees,2+ years,5,5,5,,,8,"“I like it, it's Intuitive and doesn't get in my way. ”",Overall: I'm a better project manager.,15/12/2017,"Pros: It really does make me better at my job. I can easily keep track of all my projects and effectively plan out my time. I like that it doesn't get it my way, I never spend time trying to figure out how to put something in Asana or looking for the right button. It's very intuitive. It's easy to collaborate with other employees. I like how seamlessly it integrates with other platforms as well.",Cons: They need to work on the start date/end date feature. It's pretty new but so far using it doesn't help me keep track of the project. When I sort by due date it puts the project on the bottom of my tasks because it's sorting it by the end date rather than the start date. When it would be more helpful to sort it by the start date so that I know when I need to start working on it.
1134,1134 Asana,Asana,Angela W.,"Owner, Founder",Health,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,9,“Love This System”,,10/11/2017,,"Cons: Sometimes the layout isn't as user-friendly as I would like. However, I haven't tried the calendar view because you cannot switch from a list to a calendar once you have created a project. I would love to be able to toggle these back and forth to see which I like better (for each project)."
1135,1135 Asana,Asana,Jackie B.,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“From Great Idea To Great New Offering!”,,12/9/2017,,Cons: You still have to apply discipline to which great ideas to move forward or drop altogether. People still only have a fixed amount of time in their day. No software can change that. But Asana's the right tool to help make those tough decisions.
1136,1136 Asana,Asana,Annabel F.,Residence Hall Coordinator,Education Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“This is how I organize my life!”,Overall: My life is organized and I am way more on top of things when I am using asana well.,27/7/2017,Pros: It is very flexible and can be used to meet your individual team's needs and what you want to use it for. I love how it can really streamline team communication. The app allows for seamless task management.,Cons: Just some settings things. I wish every task I create would automatically be assigned to me and have a due date of today. Tasks can sometimes disappear from the home screen without this and you have to hunt them down.
1137,1137 Asana,Asana,Chelsea W.,Manager of Operations,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Pleasure for any Project Manager”,,27/7/2017,,"Cons: Can be hard to get used to, starting out is a little confusing with all the features it does have to offer. I still don't feel like I know everything it can do"
1138,1138 Asana,Asana,Jeff S.,Vice President Marketing,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,4,4,3,8,"“Simple, But Effective”",Overall:,12/7/2017,"Pros: Easy-to-use, intuitive GUI Ability to eloquently add sub-tasks Reliable (no bugs that I can recall) Integrations with Google Apps, Evernote, etc. seamless Conversations (@tagging) & reminders",Cons: GANTT only available by mediocre plugin No time tracker Project description field too small and unorganized to provide valuable information
1139,1139 Asana,Asana,Jeff W.,Director of Finance and Administration,Philanthropy,2+ years,4,5,3,,4,9,“Asana makes project management and collaboration easy”,"Overall: We use Asana for our organization to track all kinds of projects. We've organized into teams based on departments and I can see the progress of tasks in every department. I can follow tasks, assign, re-assign, mark complete, comment and attach documents. Altogether, it's a really convenient way to track projects.",12/4/2017,"Pros: Convenience, ease of use, quick snapshot of what's going on and ability to drill down. Only those interested in a certain project follow it. Tasks are checked off and progress is made.","Cons: Since our customer support tickets are created in Salesforce, anything that turns into a project ends up being created in Asana. The API in Asana isn't open enough for us to have a seamless integration between the two."
1140,1140 Asana,Asana,Nicholas S.,Founder,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,"“If you like getting things accomplished, you need Asana”","Overall: The best part of Asana is that it gets out of the way and lets you focus on the tasks you need to do. Other project management tools feel like a chore to use. You get tied down by all of the features and it's a task just to use them. But Asana is light and flexible. It keeps you organized without being overbearing. And it's fun to use too, with lots of bright colors and fun animations. If you care about your productivity, especially if you're in a team, then check it out. My favorite feature is the inbox, where all of your notifications are in one spot.",22/2/2017,Pros: It's very colorful,Cons: Sometimes I wish it loaded a slight bit faster.
1141,1141 Asana,Asana,Katie T.,Director of Operations,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,9,“Easy to use task management”,"Overall: Our small, non-profit organization trialed Asana as we were expanding. I'd recommend this software for teams that work remotely or from several locations. Asana is intuitive and easy to use, with simple key shortcuts and plenty of options for customization. We used it the most for taking team meeting notes and then easily delegating tasks directly from the meeting agenda. Our leadership team used it often to brainstorm for projects as well. The Asana team has created a helpful onboarding guide and tutorials, and they often add fun features like celebratory confetti. Fully integrating the whole team onto the platform does take time and a plan, but Asana does provide the supports for this process. The default settings send email notifications for almost everything.

Love the flexibility of the system",Cons: Would love if the titles of our tasks could Autopopulate certain information if we wanted. e.g. In our template every task has TASK - CAMPAIGN NAME - DATE. It would be great if 1/the Campaign name auto-populated when the Project Name (this is where we put the campaign name) was updated and 2/if the Date populated with the current day when initially assigning the task. It would cut down on me rewriting the title every time I update a task and ensure that naming conventions are the same throughout.

Since adopting a Asana, Asana has continued to add features and become even more efficient/effective as a productivity tool. After using it for over a year, I've expanded to using it for meeting notes and for on boarding checklists. Some stand out features worth highlighting: - There is a mobile app that is fully featured and very functional. - I can email myself items for Asana, or anyone else on the team. - Each task or project has its own unique URL to use when referring to items outside of Asana. The only item I found lacking, was reporting.

Asana makes it easy for me to keep track of all my tasks and prioritize them. That way, my project manager doesn't have to micromanage me daily. It's also great for handing off files to my team in a seamless and organized fashion. The calendar features make it easy to coordinate with others and sync our workflows so nothing gets missed. Plus, who doesn't love checking off tasks complete to see the little creatures soaring around the screen.",17/11/2016,Pros: Easy priotization of tasks on the home screen and the little creatures that appear when you check off tasks.,Cons: The file upload limits are much too small - what about expanding it to gb?

I love the ease of use for assigning and reassigning tasks and setting due dates for individual tasks or projects. With the volume of projects that our department works on, it is invaluable to get a birds eye view of where each project stands in terms of the specific elements of the project. I do wish that the mobile version allowed for sorting of tasks by due date.",17/11/2016,Pros: It's ease of use. Being able to follow up with specific individuals that were assigned tasks. Very clear project tracking system,Cons: I can get a little unwieldy when others are using the software incorrectly and/or assigning tasks that are not connected to a specific project.

Shortcuts are amazing, collaboration is easy, and I find the subtask structure to be the feature that makes Asana stand out from other project management software. I would like to see the interface be more flexible. I find move subtasks from one task to another to be clumsy and it would be great if the main interface itself made better use of monitor space. I wonder if there might be some useful visuals that could live within the project view? Could tasks be viewed in a different way other than just the typical stacked method that I have to scroll through? When I go /f fullscreen on a task I would love to see much more functionality. Lots of opportunity. Keep up the great work, it's not perfect but I love to keep up with the changes that are continually made and it's still my favorite project management software.",3/11/2016,Pros: Subtasks and collaboration.,Cons: Clumsy task movement and mediocre use of fullscreen possibility.

Being able to create different projects where you can share your progress as well as have multiple people assisting and recording their's makes internal communicate a breeze",3/11/2016,Pros: The ability to create and manage projects and follow up on assigned tasks for the ease of communication with multiple parties.,Cons: It takes a bit of a learning curve to figure out what you can and cannot see and do. The placement of projects in the side bar with small text makes it hard to find the first time and as you get more and more of them they become even more difficult to find and track.

I manage graphic designers and make sure everything gets done on time and with great quality. Asana helps me do that. The one problem I have is dragging tasks to different projects doesn't work. I have tried disabling extensions in Chrome and nothing seems to fix it. I have to manually type in the task which project I want it to go in.,3/11/2016,"Pros: The clean design, ease of use. It feels friendly and doesn't look like ''work''. Unicorns help.","Cons: The dragging glitch that happens when trying to move tasks to projects. The iOS app could also update faster, sometimes when I open the app I get freaked out that tasks haven't been completed but then 4-5 seconds later it updates and they change."

Sometimes these break long established workflows (and workarounds). It is not a great tool for complex project management when you need multi level dependencies as other Gantt charting tools offer.
1165,1165 Asana,Asana,Jessica L.,Systems Analyst,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,,4,10,“Most effective project management tool and tracker”,"Overall: Of all the free version PM tools out there, Asana is the best by far! Good interface, great features, great website and app, and it's great to keep track of your own privately, share, or track projects across your whole team! Asana has a better, more efficient, and more intuitive interface than other products like Trello. And it's not as expensive as Microsoft Project. And it still uses the Kanban style boards of all of these types, which is one of the best PM methods while also being really versatile based on needs",10/6/2020,"Pros: My FAVORTIE thing about Asana is how much you can do with it for yourself, and with your team, and across your company, and all for free","Cons: I really love Asana, it will always be my go to.

1167,1167 Asana,Asana,Laura B.,Designer,Design,2+ years,4,5,4,5,,9,“To Do VS Project Management”,Overall: The free version is VERY worthwhile! There are so many useful features - I especially like being able to add due dates and see these in a calendar view.,30/4/2020,"Pros: I found Asana to be a great to-do list organizer. I think the most significant feature is being able to change what kind of 'view' you see each project. I am a visual person so being able to see my projects and to-do's with the 'Board' feature instead of they traditional list format was a game changer! Who new a different layout could be so helpful in organizing your thoughts and to-do list items. With this, I also like that you can drag and drop items to easily rearrange and reorganize your items.",Cons: I was looking for a tool that I could used for project management. I think Asana has all the features needed to be this kind of tool but only if your teammates or coworkers use Asana seriously. This is less a critique on the product and maybe more of a critique on my company! But to make this tool useful all persons involved should get a simple training on how to use. This has the potential to eliminate the need for internal office emailing if used correctly.

I have really enjoyed how easy it is to train new team members while keeping our business organized.,"Cons: I would like to be able to assign a task to two people at once.

Living in the world of communication at a multi-campus church with tons of events this is huge,"Cons: It can be difficult to learn at first. My team has struggle to grasp its importance in what we do and how easy it can make things, but once they get it and are on board, they learn more and more tricks that make their lives easier."

It's nice to have a snapshot of where I am in a project and what I have left to get done.,Cons: People assign me tasks without restrictions. Recurring sub tasks don't seem to work properly and create too many duplicates when completed.

My work colleagues have been really good about putting in projects/tasks and assigning them to me with all of the necessary details. I think it has made me a more productive designer in that I'm able to readily access information.,3/12/2019,"Pros: I like how intuitive this software is. I've used a handful of other project management tools in the past, and this by far has been the easiest program. Most others we end up using really heavily at first and then we trail off, but with Asana we've been really consistent. I think that is a testament to the way it is set up, and how easy it is to create different projects and tasks in an organized manner. I personally appreciate the daily/weekly reminders to help keep me on track with work.","Cons: There is nothing that I particularly dislike about this software.

It also lets you comment on all tasks and milestones, providing updates to your teammates on the status of tasks.","Cons: There is a bit of confusion when creating tasks sometimes, because some tasks may be created outside of the project - which causes it to be a stand-alone task. If you are writing a task under a project or milestone, it must be created within the item itself, or else the stand-alone task may not be seen by everyone."

It blends very well with our agile process.,27/2/2019,"Pros: I love its flexibility to separate work into different ways, it is very good for simple projects and complex processes as well. It does everything quite good: Tasks functionality is quite good, lets you group tasks by projects and also treats each task as a project if needed so that teams can work on multiple levels at the same time.

For project management, it's also fairly straightforward to put all work in a taskboard or gantt style dashboard.",Cons: Honestly there wasn't many negatives. Asana has done quite a good work over the years and today's version might be the best that they've had so far.

This product makes the sharing of those accounts, and steps that may remain in that process, easy to share/see/use.","Cons: There are not a lot of tutorials on how to use it. Also, if the other users you share the account with set something up you are not always of how they did or how to replicate it. Also, this is a unique scenario that a lot of companies will not share. This makes it a unique experience."

Very easy to setup reoccurring tasks to team members, easily make subtasks, create templates for project use.","Cons: Attaching images - would like to see inline images displayed in task as opposed to attachments to download.

1202,1202 Asana,Asana,Josh B.,Program Implementation Manager,Construction,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,9,“Affordable and Sustainable”,,8/1/2019,,"Cons: There's a bit of a learning curve for everyone who uses this product, the first time.

For the office work by project, collaborative and integrator, its use is very successful.",18/12/2018,"Pros: It is a very complete organizer of tasks, its possibility to organize the views according to the convenience of the user makes it more friendly. The subtask menu, tracking; and the possibility of engaging with your google calendar makes it more attractive. The free version has everything you need and ability to work with several people.

Being able to allocate tasks to specific staff make sure nothing is falling through the cracks. The Outlook plugin is a true help,Cons: I dislike the influx of email is brings. Entirely too many notifications about tasks that aren't relevant to specific duties. The premium version is costly for our non-profit and the free version is lacking in extra features such as timelines and an advance search function.

Being able to have a conversation under projects avoid unnecessary confusion.,28/11/2018,"Pros: As a company with multiple projects running, we are able to create multiple projects and assign it to the team members. I am always able to keep track of the progress in each project.

I've worked in Trello too but it's not as organized, I like the vertical workflow opposed to Trello's horizontal boards.",21/11/2018,"Pros: The 2 min training videos are so simple and easy to follow.

1209,1209 Asana,Asana,Geoff B.,VP Marketing,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“I love Asana”,Overall: I've been able to satisfy our IT and Marketing Teams where they can each have custom flows with as much flexibility or rigidity that is needed for their ongoing needs or project specific ones.,2/11/2018,Pros: I really like the flexibility to create any type of workflow you need for any type of team. It's been extremely helpful to customize flows for our marketing team so they can look at a todo list as well as by calendar day.,Cons: With too much flexibility comes the problem where team members can break your process and you have to lock down the permission levels. However Asana has solved that problem in their enterprise level subscriptions.
1210,1210 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Consumer Electronics,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Templated processes makes repeatable tasks so much easier.”,,24/10/2018,,"Cons: Templates are a paid feature, so for me to get the most out of the solution, I did have to allocate an unplanned portion of my budget to Project management.

The flying unicorn at the end is always a plus and is a great motivator. It doesn't feel like you are writing a task list with Asana. It almost makes me feel like I am in a virtual workspace.",Cons: I don't like how you now MUST pay for the version even if you have a small number of people on your team. When I first found Asana it was free. I wish my company had more of a long term chance to use it because I know they would absolutely be on board with buying it if the trial was longer and they could get more time with it.

However, learning can be time consuming, so we are breaking it down in chunks. 1-2 new learning tasks per week.",16/10/2018,"Pros: Asana has a ton of features that you can use to get organized. I particularly like the option of having workspaces, where you can organize tasks by client. I also enjoy the task conversation board where you and your colleagues can converse without sending a million emails and save time looking thru your inbox to find what you need. You can also email directly to the conversation board and/or each project if you wish. I also use the gmail/Asana integration where I can create tasks for Asana directly from my gmail- Stupendous","Cons: There is a bit of a learning curve and if your staff does not sign in and USE the platform, it will not be successful for your organization. There is a lot to learn, but once you set it up to optimize your work flow, you will be good. It's not an ""easy"" fix, you have to ""work it"" to get where you want to be- Organized!"

Asana is our management process for every single project and task in our organization,Cons: I think some of the client facing features could be improved.

Includes the most needed features for free: multiple team members per project, can assign task owner & deadlines, can create sub-task lists, and can switch between a personal & team workspace.","Cons: If you don't follow the Asana tips when setting up your projects you can find yourself disorganized, so you need to (should!) follow their guidelines. I guess this applies to any project management system but it took me a few attempts before really jumping on the Asana bandwagon. Be patient with it and you'll love it, especially compared to other free solutions for small teams."

It allows to set up system for task and project management - and has all features that help to keep you move forward and not forget things.",Cons: Sometimes I'm a bit overwhelmed with features they add and it seems they consider it more a collaboration than project management.
1230,1230 Asana,Asana,Chelsea W.,Operations Manager,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Awesome for team organization”,Overall: All of the organization,5/3/2018,Pros: I love Asana for keeping my team on track! We all update our projects and know exactly where everything is. The subtask feature is awesome for detailing out next steps in each project. Celebration animals are a nice touch,"Cons: It does take a while for someone to learn how to efficiently use all of the features in Asana. Also, with a large team Asana can get ""cluttered"" if people don't proactively keep up with it."
1231,1231 Asana,Asana,Charli F.,Marketing Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,3,5,10,“I could not function without Asana.”,"Overall: When people ask me for updates on projects, I don't answer without checking asana. I keep all my notes, to-dos, and thoughts in asana so I can stay on top of multiple projects split amongst different business departments.",26/2/2018,"Pros: It's SUPER easy to use. I like that I can navigate most of it with my keyboard making it ideal for note-taking and capturing meeting minutes. I like that I can use it for personal tasks as well as company tasks and projects. Also, it's free/cheap for small teams",
1232,1232 Asana,Asana,Karen B.,CFO,Food & Beverages,2+ years,5,5,4,,5,10,“Asana Helps my Team Organize Tasks”,,21/12/2017,,Cons: Sometimes I am overwhelmed about the amount of tasks in Asana and I would like to find an easy way to clean them up. There are some tasks I haven't used that are no longer relevant.
1233,1233 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,4,3,5,2,5,9,“Took a While for Me to Like this Software”,"Overall: task management, saves time, better then pen and paper",21/12/2017,"Pros: Not going to lie, I didn't like this software at first. I felt I didn't need to keep track of tasks and management online, but once I took some time to learn how to use asana I'd never go back! I love the tracking views, column views, team collaboration, etc. Before asana, I was using pen and paper. Yikes",Cons: It was hard to learn. It was confusing and it took a while for me to really learn the software. I haven't used customer service yet. I wouldn't even know how to contact them so that's not easy and up front.
1234,1234 Asana,Asana,Fernando P.,Head Of Customer Experience,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“We have been using Asana to manage and track all our projects and It is a fantastic software!”,"Overall: Manage all the teams, tasks and projects very easily",12/11/2017,"Pros: Collaboration on top of all things, with Asana everybody knows what is happening with each product, everybody know what each teammate is working on and the status of everything. If you educate your team to use it properly It would be an awesome tool to manage your company. It is very easy to create teams, start projects and organize them in different views, define tasks, owners and deadlines, really awesome.","Cons: It would be great to have more options of views from the projects, a better calendar view and a Gantt style view like we can do with Instagantt. Also lacks some tool to manage the whole company and have a big picture of everything that is happening at the moment or during certain amount of time."

I tried several other Project Management Tool before. Some even had better and more features than Asana, but never this kind of clear and well organize interface. In my line of work, being able to stay focus on the priorities and not missing anything crucial is key.",Cons: The only feature I don't find very practical in Asana is the conversation user experience. The readability should be improved...

It takes a minute to show up. This really only happens once a day, it just is noticeable in a world where applications load so quickly."
1237,1237 Asana,Asana,Emeka O.,Data Scientist in Residence,Research,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Best productivity tool”,Overall: Asana is the only productivity tool I have sticked with after trying many other alternatives. It is simple and easy to maintain. Asana has lots of integration which makes it good for all levels,30/5/2017,"Pros: I used the free version which gives enough features for most basic applications before upgrading to paid. so far, I don't have any regrets.","Cons: I wish it could have easy way to track time expended without the expensive time tracking add on. Other than this, it is a must have app"
1238,1238 Asana,Asana,Emily B.,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Simple at first look; but packed with features you learn as you go along”,"Overall: I've been using Asana for two years now to manage projects for a web development company, and I've been incredibly impressed with the features and capabilities throughout. When I first started with Asana, I definitely thought it would be too simple to manage what I needed - however, with all of the plethora of features and options to sort tasks, assign, manage, attach details, and see the results, I've been extremely pleasantly surprised. It's simple enough that you can add a task in a few seconds (whereas with other task management systems it would require you to ) Additionally, it links with all kinds of third party software - Slack, Freshdesk, Zapier, Google Drive and Trackduck are just a couple of the integrations we've tried. We've considered moving to other softwares a few times, but just can't seem to let it go - and there's a reason for that",1/3/2017,"Pros: It's super easy to add a new task - you can do it in two clicks from any page within Asana. However, it's also complex enough to organize templates, manage schedule and workflow for multiple people and multiple projects, and support multiple kinds of project management methodology.","Cons: I'd like to see the main view - each person's Incomplete Tasks view - built out more, allowing for more easy prioritization rather than just Today, Upcoming and Later. With all the tasks I have, those three ways to categorize my own tasks aren't enough, especially when you are dealing with a LOT of tasks per day."
1239,1239 Asana,Asana,Dawn J.,Designer,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,3,3,5,5,9,“Time for Feedback”,"Overall: I use Asana daily and it's great for our project organization and keeping track of tasks and projects on the go. For the most part, it handles our workflow very well. Like every program, there are some things that would make things even smoother, but all in all, it does the job.",7/12/2016,Pros: Look and feel; interface,"Cons: Not able to assign more than one person to a project; not able to copy and paste some things; once I organize my project list, it doesn't keep the order (glitch?)"
1240,1240 Asana,Asana,David D.,Media Designer,Textiles,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Great Tool for work AND your personal life”,"Overall: After working for years with many different project management software, nothing has yet been as easy to learn and use as Asana. The complete Flow from start to finish is so intuitive and quick, that it replaced nearly all my work emails! I use it on a daily basis at work and for my private project with friends.",6/12/2016,"Pros: Quick creation of tasks, multi-edit on the fly, nice API, and themes",Cons: Inbox posts with a lot of attachments as comments are often too long. I would like to see a max-height of the boxes.
1241,1241 Asana,Asana,Stephanie N.,Owner,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,3,3,4,5,7,"“Hey, it's free!”","Overall: Are there better project management tools out there? Yes. But for the very reasonable price of nothing, Asana cannot be beat! I haven't graduated to any of their paid/PRO features, so I can only speak to the basic functionalities. I personally like Trello more, but was out-voted in my group... this is a good sub and they've even recently added a Trello-like feature for those of us who prefer that look. Asana is great to keep projects and team discussions compartmentalized. Outside of that, the calendar is difficult to use and it's hard to search discussions across many projects. We probably should have read some tutorials before setting up our project structure too, because once you've got a bunch of stuff in there, you kinda have to blow it all up and start over if you end up wanting to change something. It's easy to paint yourself into corner",28/11/2016,Pros: Free,Cons: Cumbersome. Hard to make adjustments to organization structure
1242,1242 Asana,Asana,Charlie F.,Marketing Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,9,“Great for getting things done!”,Overall: Asana improves transparency and helps you keep track of all your tasks. It's easy to quickly create tasks and help keep yourself accountable for getting them done. The simple design makes it easy to customize and use in a way that is best for your team. We used their free version for 2 years before we needed to upgrade to the paid (but inexpensive) version.,28/11/2016,Pros: How easy it is to use and customize. I like that there is a mobile app and several ways to be notified.,Cons: It freezes when our WiFi is interrupted.
1243,1243 Asana,Asana,Dean I.,Client Solutions Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,3,4,4,4,8,“Great system for click based usage; keyboard strokes not intuitive”,"Overall: Asana is a great, very visual system for those using a mouse or touch screen. As a keyboard shortcut person, I find the shortcuts less intuitive and disparate from PC/Mac ones. This does make it tricky to do things from muscle memory",3/11/2016,"Pros: Nice visuals, good for cross team collaboration and task tracking, easy to learn the basics","Cons: Keyboard shortcuts hard to learn, some options and menus are hard to find, lacks a personal dashboard that shows all projects and teams you are a part of in a summarized but with task detail view, Zapier connection to Outlook and note software is not very seamless"
1244,1244 Asana,Asana,Dani S.,SEO Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,4,5,5,8,“Promotes Teamwork & Increases On-time Productivity”,"Overall: We have been using Asana for a while now and have found it to be very effective in managing client projects. I work remotely, so having the tasks listed by priority and due date has been very helpful. I would highly recommend Asana, as it is customizable and very easy to use.",3/11/2016,"Pros: It is simple to set-up and use. We hooked our time tracking software right to it, so that helps too.","Cons: It would be nice to create ""folders"" within the large tasks for documents, notes, etc. I do not like that you can't hide the section where people add or change dates. That can get really long when the project takes a while."
1245,1245 Asana,Asana,Bryce C.,Managing Editor,Publishing,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,10,“Perfect For Short and Long Term Scheduling”,"Overall: I manage a team of about 20 people and find Asana to be very effective when it comes to project scheduling and long term big picture scheduling. It allows me to plan for the day and week but also give myself tasks and reminders for the next year or two. It's also helped prevent meeting agenda items from being forgotten because I can add them at any time using the meeting project format. For someone who operates in multiple departments and juggles specific detailed tasks and big picture ideas, this software has improved my productivity significantly and I would recommend it to anyone in a similar position.",3/11/2016,"Pros: Easy to add tasks anywhere, anytime. Long term planning abilities are extremely helpful.",Cons: Isn't as evolved as some of the Google apps and software but that mostly just means the current absence of some creature comforts I've become accustomed to. It's improving all the time so it's not a big concern.

I use it to manage small to-do lists, to organize meetings, and to work on multi-team projects with dozens of other people to make sure deadlines are met and cross-team communication is clear.",3/11/2016,"Pros: It's very flexible -- you can adapt it to fit many different types of projects. We use it for internal communications, managing projects and even simply collecting lists of information. It provides features that let you share tasks across projects, build production calendars that collate multiple projects and a lot more. It's basically how I stay on top of all of my work and the work of my teams.",Cons: Duplicating projects with many tasks can be slow.
1247,1247 Asana,Asana,Chirag S.,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,10,“Great tool for distributing and measuring work tasks”,Overall: We all use asana very regularly. It's great to distribute tasks and see how much is done and pending. It also helps in organizing and planning projects.,3/11/2016,"Pros: Love that I can reply/create tasks via mail. Assigning tasks, and checking the calendar for the planned schedule. Adding followers is very easy.",Cons: Not great to use as a personal to-do manager. I prefer todoist for this. THe quick add feature on todoist is too good.
1248,1248 Asana,Asana,Brian K.,Tech Manager,Music,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“You need this task manager”,"Overall: Our administrative team uses Asana to keep track of all of our work, from our personal duties up to large collaborative projects. Once you've used a task manager, you'll wonder how you ever got by without it. Several members of our team have even started using it to keep track of things outside of work. You can set up multiple workspaces and share them with different groups of people. I have one for my day job, one for my side business, and one for general stuff at home.",11/10/2016,Pros: Excellent task manager with organizational and collaborative features.,Cons: Has to reload sometimes.

Then we found asana. And it ticked all the boxes. It's continued to impress since,30/10/2020,Pros: One of the key things that asana does very well is allow us to understand an overview of each teams workload,Cons: It's quite hard to pick anything. The biggest thing is the cost but even that is not completely unreasonable

I can look back to my previous tasks for tracing my incomes. I also can plan my tasks ahead by looking at its built-in calendar.,21/10/2020,Pros: Alert my tasks via my email. There is chatbox for easy collaboration with my teams. The features are easy to navigate.,Cons: Colour theme of the website looks a bit plain. Menus are all in white. If there are different colour of menus would be able to spot what important better.
1252,1252 Asana,Asana,Dante F.,Jefe de Operaciones,Outsourcing/Offshoring,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,8,“Proyectos en conjunto”,"Overall: Funciona perfectamente para avanzar tareas y proyectos en conjunto, tiene diferentes tipos y estilos de presentaciones: calendarios, listados, etc. Se puede ver el avance, asignar tareas, etc. Sincronizar con google el proyecto te hace estar más online.",14/10/2020,Pros: es fácil y sencillo.

1254,1254 Asana,Asana,ATHAN D.,Researcher,Biotechnology,2+ years,4,2,4,,3,6,"“Fully-featured, if you pay”","Overall: I became more and more frustrated as I used Asana. As a personal task manager, most of the features are exclusive to their paid subscriptions, or are just not intuitive for easy task management.",23/9/2020,"Pros: Asana has been around for awhile, and rightfully has the most abundant feature set of task/project managers out there. Also it boasts good integration with other productivity/communications software","Cons: When managing tasks for an individual or a small team, Asana becomes clunky. Its hard to view all tasks at a glance, and could benefit from free gantt charts and other visualizations of a task overview."
1255,1255 Asana,Asana,Edward K.,Membership Technology Specialist,Computer Software,2+ years,4,2,4,,,3,“Less engaging than other project management software”,,18/9/2020,,Cons: It's one of those products that works well in theory - but life often doesn't follow the theory! I found its structure too rigid. I also use project management software to collaborate with clients. I find clients didn't really engage with Asana though. I now use Trello and have a much higher engagement rate.

This greatly improves our productivity.",28/8/2020,"Pros: We appreciate the ease of use that comes with this software. We have tried other task management tools without satisfaction.

We also appreciate the addition of new features without having to shell out more money.",Cons: If they could improve searching for projects that would speed up the process of finding what you need.

It may have a bit of a learning curve if you want to use it to its full capacity, but it is worth it"

And because I have every task and every project together in one place I am not having to worry about remembering what I need to do for the day.,5/5/2020,"Pros: I have been in business for 10 years and am generally an organized person. But the past year or so I have been struggling with haphazard to-do lists pasted into my written daytimer in conjunction with my google calendar.. I have been dropping the ball - and that is not something i can afford to do as a solopreneur. I started looking at project management apps and after personally comparing the 3 top apps - I chose Asana. I am so pleased with my choice. Asana is geared at big companies as well as small, and after I found a youtube video on how to set up asana for solopreneurs I was on my way! This software is life changing for me! I really can't believe I didn't look into sooner",Cons: For a small business person - with only one employee (me!) I wish I didn't have to pay for two. And with the Canadian Dollar exchange rate being so poor right now this software costs me upwards of $30 per month.

Made my life easier.,11/4/2020,"Pros: I loved this software. It is easy to use and easy to understand. Colour coded tasks and assigning a task is easy. Since it has the reports and timeline, keeping track of assigned tasks is simple and the reporting is very user friendly too. The interface looks professional too although I used the paid version.",Cons: You can only add 15 members to a board! That is very hard so we had to skip subordinates and allocate the tasks to the managers. That was frustrating!

My favorite feature is that I can bcc the email address and create a task directly from my email where it also saves all the communication of the email in the notes section of the task.,"Cons: There's not a lot Asana doesn't answer for me in terms of project management software, but it would be more widely adopted by our organization if there was Windows desktop application."

To be able to work on the same workflow from various locations is priceless. We will put this to use",8/11/2019,"Pros: Asana seems to be a good tool that will help our team, as it grows, to manage the work flow of our project initiatives. When all team members have the ability to collaborate on the same project flow, it creates a sense of focused unity, as well as efficient progress.","Cons: This is not necessarily a ""least"" about the software - we like the software. We did the free trial for the time being as our team is coming together and expanding. When we have OUR side better established it will be a better time to proceed with a more complete package. From what I have gathered, I recommend the software - I just need to complete the building of the team to utilize it most effectively!"
1275,1275 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Publishing,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,"“Excellent UI, love the project board”","Overall: In my team, we've tried some other project management websites as well, but we keep coming back to Asana. It has a very good UI. Easier for a new person in the team to get used to.",16/10/2019,"Pros: The UI. It's extremely well done: clear and intuitive. The choice of copying or duplicating tasks and whole projects is brilliant. And a task can be assigned to multiple projects, so the team or the necessary stakeholders can easily view the progress or backlog from different perspectives.","Cons: Once you choose a project board layout, you can't switch, which forces you to delete it and create a new one."
1276,1276 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Design,2+ years,5,4,4,,,8,“Simple Task Management for Small Groups”,"Overall: It's very pleasant. As I said, the color codes keep me focused on the tasks of higher importance and closer deadlines. It's easy to let my collaborators know when I'm done with things and what notes I've taken with existing tasks.",27/9/2019,"Pros: The interface makes it easy to look at my tasks, prioritize them, let the team know what's done and what's in progress, and share notes and feedback. I used Trello in a small team years ago and it didn't work so well. Asana was great for our team of five folks in a Communications department with a ton of projects. I respond well to color codes, and Asana lets us color code the collaborators, categories of project subjects, and other qualities. I love the ""Due Date"" feature because I love knowing when deadlines are.","Cons: Probably that it's a software I have to push people to use often. My executive director doesn't use Asana, rather he uses a more analog or otherwise stripped-down approach to manage his tasks. For some people, the ""frills"" in Asana takes some getting used to for older folks, but my collaborators managed to communicate those tasks to him anyways even before Asana."
1277,1277 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,E-Learning,2+ years,5,4,4,3,3,7,“Great app for team management ”,,18/9/2019,,"Cons: Support is a bad, ux could see some improvements"
1278,1278 Asana,Asana,Allen H.,Project Manager,Design,2+ years,4,5,4,,5,7,“Fantastic task management for projects”,Overall:,30/8/2019,"Pros: Templates making setting up a new project incredibly easy. If you take on lots of projects that generally have the same steps to completion I highly recommend using Asana. The multiple views, such as calendar and timeline often prove useful. Being able to make subtasks and tasks dependant on other tasks has also helped keep things organized. I can't cover all of the features offered by Asana but those are some that have helped me the most.","Cons: I have two gripes about Asana. The first is how you can't assign multiple people to a task. The Asana team is just being stubborn and should leave it up to administrators to decide whether or not to allow this. The other thing is, I wish there was a kanban board view for my own tasks. I get lots of different tasks from different projects. Sometimes I wish I had more options than just ""Today"", ""Upcoming"" and ""Later"" People have found loopholes to get around this restriction but it would be simpler if it was just part of the package."
1279,1279 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Biotechnology,2+ years,5,5,4,5,5,9,“Great intuitive UI and a must for managing projects!”,"Overall: It is an intuitive and easy way to keep a large team organized, and it keeps everyone up to date regarding the progress of a project for transparency as well. It also makes it easier to see when deadlines should be moved based on real time progress updates.",27/8/2019,"Pros: When managing collaborative projects across multiple sites and sometimes across time zones, coordinating activities and making sure everyone comes together to meet specific deadlines is an absolute must. Asana is a great way to make sure that happens, and it offers ways to easily toggle between projects and see overall progress on projects. I really like the easy-to-use user interface that is graphically -driven and color coded, making it easy to learn and use. I work with a lot of physicians and administrators that don't want to take the time to learn new software, so Asana is a great tool that is super easy to set up and learn, and allows them to communicate their status, as well as allowing the rest of the team to request updates.","Cons: It can be a little overwhelming when there are many tasks that need to be done, and I haven't yet found a way to prioritize them so that I can arrange by most important project. Additionally, getting a constant string of notifications every time anyone completes a task or updates the project is rather annoying, and you have to go through and toggle off each of the notifications to ensure that you don't accidentally miss anything important."

In our team, we use it to follow up on team and induvidual tasks and has improved our performance and the timing of our projects.",16/8/2019,"Pros: I found it really easy to learn. Eventhough we use the basic plan, It has been very usefull for me and my team. We've been able to manage the time we spend in our projects and to follow up on our daily tasks.","Cons: It would be usefull to have a list of keyboard shortcuts so creating tasks could be faster. I've found that sometimes I don't receive the notification email when a task is completed. Is not that often, but it happens."

Multiple options for keeping your data and projects organized and on task.,"Cons: I wish their was a better sorting feature. Often times, with multiple projects going on simantaneously, I'd like to be able to sort alphabetically or numerically. It has many other sorting options for ease of use, but currently not alphabetically or numerically."
1285,1285 Asana,Asana,Zara I.,Director,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Great for managing tasks for my team”,,16/7/2019,,Cons: I need to access it for a number of different clients using different emails so it would be good to toggle between accounts like I can with Google instead of having to always sign in and out.
1286,1286 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Writing and Editing,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“A deep platform”,"Overall: As a freelancer, it isn't something that I would normally need for myself. My biggest client, though, is a company that does marketing and web development and SaaS development and a host of other things. For everything they do, they're a fairly small team. Asana is one of the few threads that consistently keeps all of these projects consistently moving in the right direction. In summary, it's a VERY useful tool, especially in the right hands.",31/5/2019,"Pros: It makes organization and coordination of projects - of any size - so much easier. I've used it fairly extensively as a member of my client's team, on multiple projects, and it can help to leverage productivity out of situations that might otherwise stall the project out for three or four times as long.","Cons: Exactly how useful the platform is depends quite a lot on the PM. Some PMs will leverage more value out of it than others. This has to do with just how deep the interface runs. Not every aspect of the UI is inherently intuitive. There are still functions, I'm sure, that I'm unaware of or not utilizing fully. It's one of those platforms that can be a bit daunting. It's not difficult, per se, but it isn't simple, either."
1287,1287 Asana,Asana,Varinder S.,Project Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Mind-blowing Project Handling Platform!”,Overall: Asana is a really great tool in modern life to handle the projects and tasks in any MNC or IT sector company. You can just create and assign and then you just need to track the progress. Its a real relief to the paperwork. Love it.,27/5/2019,Pros: Asana is a great platform to create and assign projects to different developers. You can simply create any task and assign to your team member. Team members can be added easily via an invitation to their emails. You can track the project progress and even share the details to the developers. You can put security as well for the details. This is full pack software from the creation of task to the end of any task. Just love it.,"Cons: In Asana, you can create any task in different projects, but if you want the same task in any other project, then you need to create it from the beginning. You can't duplicate or move any task from one project to another. That's the only thing that I stuck with. Overall it's a great project handler."
1288,1288 Asana,Asana,DENNIS A.,STUDENT,Sports,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,10,“Teaming made interesting ”,"Overall: Project management was and still remains one of the most hectic tasks amongst many people. But with Asana, the whole process is now fun and easier. The features make arranging a project quite easy and even communicating and updating other team members easier. The interface also is welcoming to new clients who get the urge to explore and learn more about its capability. It has made project management simpler than never before, what a masterpiece.",19/5/2019,"Pros: The most interesting thing about Asana is its perfect and captivating in-App guidance that gives the users an easy time while using it. Managing a group of people can be hectic and thus Asana seeks to make the whole experience enjoyable and fun. Moreover, the application is cheap and affordable to most people making it popular.

It's intuitive and clearly built with every detail in mind. I also love all the little functions like bolding + enlarging the text to break up sections. Asana has thought of everything,2/5/2019,Pros: I absolutely love how deep we can break projects down - the subtask area is beyond helpful,"Cons: For whatever reason, I don't always get my email notifications when someone assigns or tags me. This causes me to miss things occasionally."

It makes task management that much easier because it's so easy to look at. That being said, I would recommend Asana to anyone with a team larger than three people that has multiple projects or clients they need to focus on.","Cons: Some features can be confusing, for example - using tab as a modifier key or adding a colon to create a section."
1291,1291 Asana,Asana,Ingo N.,CTO,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,9,“Great project and task management tool for diverse teams”,Overall: IMHO Asana is a must have tool for distributed teams that will bring tremendous value to project planning and management,26/4/2019,"Pros: Asana offers several task planing approaches and views- not comparable with classic project planning but far better suited for agile approaches. We now prefer using the Board view, known from agile. It is simple to add subtasks, add screenshots or even videos to task comments as feedback.","Cons: Kind of missing a task time line with task dependencies as in a GANTT chart. Time tracking for tasks can only be dopne using external tools, suchj as TMetric."

Stellar product. Highly recommended.",12/4/2019,"Pros: The ability to arrange and prioritize tasks, and assign them to other team members. I also love the ability to add team members to new projects, and have Asana notify them via email. Also, Asana keeps data related to a task together, whether they be Word docs, database diagrams, images, PDF files, etc. This allows you to see the task in its entirety. Along with MS Teams, this is our primary task management tool and it does this very, very well.","Cons: Nothing. At first I was frustrated you couldn't have headers for groups of related tasks, but I just learned you can place a colon after the task name and it will become a header task. Nice!"

It is free for upto 15 users 3. You can create a task and assign it to a member of the team 4. Enhanced communication and collaboration in the workplace,26/7/2018,"Pros: The best thing about Asana is you can have Asana with most its features for upto 15 users in a company. Asana has beautiful design and you can be able to manage different projects of a company on the interface. One awesome feature about Asana is the ability to create tasks which can be assigned to different members of your team. You can even have conversations and notes around those tasks. With Asana there is an option to create a to do list with your team members. Asana even allows you to keep a calendar in the app. If a company is more task and to-do list oriented, then Asana is the best option for a communication and collaboration tool.","Cons: There is a learning curve that is required for employees to be able to fully utilize the features of the app, but once you get the hang of it, Asana is awesome. Another disadvantage is that Asana can be expensive for big companies with many users."

Unable to edit comments - this means if you make a mistake, you have to delete the comment and start again. 2. Unable to export comments - This one is a bummer, however not the end of the world."

We can track progress and use previous timelines to build future timelines.,23/7/2018,"Pros: Ease of use, I can easily assign tasks to multiple people. Being able to add contingencies is a critical capability for our organization.","Cons: Becomes arduous when building out complex timelines, but using Instagantt fills in where Asana lacks on it's own."
1320,1320 Asana,Asana,Kayla R.,HR Manager,Unspecified,2+ years,4,3,3,5,4,9,“Great software for task management”,,18/7/2018,,Cons: I would say the main disadvantage that this software has is that it doesn't integrate goal setting and performance management into their program. Would be nice to track goals + tasks simultaneously.
1321,1321 Asana,Asana,Osa L.,Marketing,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,4,4,5,8,“Keeps everything you need in one place”,,12/7/2018,,"Cons: It's a steep learning curve for people who are not used to project management software, and there are often people working on a project that are not comfortable with project management software, so it's best to set aside time for trainings."
1322,1322 Asana,Asana,Aníbal O.,Diseñador instruccional,11-50 employees,2+ years,5,4,4,4,4,9,“Asana helps us organize tasks on our team managing time and resources while improving productivity.”,"Overall: Asana helps us manage our team's effort, organizing tasks, assigning tasks for each team member and showing the expected date of delivery for each one. It is an useful tool for project management that helps us improve our productivity.",24/6/2018,"Pros: Asana is a wonderful tool that allows me and my team to organize our assignments on a a project on a nice visual interface that actually do a lot for our productivity. I have used several project management tools before and what sets Asana apart is the ability to create a task, assign it to somebody and setting a date for it. That way the whole team is aware of who's responsable for each task and when we can expect it to be ready. This is fantastic for managing our time and improve productivity.","Cons: Although it is possible to assign tasks for multiple team members, one issue we have found with Asana is the way it handles this. Instead of adding another name to the responsable's list, Asana actually duplicates the task to indicate more team members are responsable for it. This gets the job done, but also creates redundancy and unnecessarily complicates the project's board."

I have been using the free version for a long time and have not needed to upgrade yet. I love that they have two options for the layout for those of us with different working styles. You have the option of using a list format and/or a board format. I am using the board format which I think just looks prettier and works for my style. Asana also has an app so I can easily check my projects, calendar and more right on my phone and get notifications of what's due without having to log onto my computer. There are tons of features like reminders and such that make projects and everyday tasks easy to accomplish.",Cons: I honestly cannot find a bad thing to say but I guess if you do have a large team you will need to upgrade which does cost money. Some of the features also cost money so it would depend on your needs. I use Asana for my business and for home and have never needed to upgrade yet.
1324,1324 Asana,Asana,Giorgi G.,Lead Customer Care,Tobacco,2+ years,4,5,4,4,5,8,“Great team management tool”,,16/6/2018,,"Cons: What I dislike is that sometimes task management setup requires quite a time and it kinda looks like unnatural, I mean the view. Thus, requiring so much time it doesn't make the Asana the best personal management tool but the team. Also, Asana's mobile app is not ven closely as good as the web. That clearly needs improvements."

I ended up using a different software.”,Overall: It helped me run my business and personal life for a little while.,14/6/2018,"Pros: It has a clean interface, has many different options that work for every business and every lifestyle. Very easy to integrate a team member if needed.","Cons: It's very difficult to use. One thing I could not stand, and was one of my reasons for switching to another software was that you can't see all of your projects unless you click ""view more"" on the side menu to view all of your projects. Because I have so much going on, I feel like this enabled me to not have everything in view. So out of sight out of mind if you will. Overall, I feel like it wasn't very ideal for people who have more than one project going on and need to see everything that is on their plate."

1328,1328 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,4,3,4,,,7,“Detailed and organised task management”,,24/4/2018,,"Cons: On the fence with the UX. The fact that I can't organise my sidebar becomes overwhelming. There are some teams/projects that I am a part of but am not actively working on, so sometimes I want to move them around but I'm unable to do so. Also, the notifications could be so much better. I don't see why I have to go to the Inbox all the time to check everything and move away from my current page. It's not very easy to see the difference between new and old notifications either - hardly any difference between what you've seen before and what has just come in."

Also, members of the project can add tasks as needed as well and then it notifies others, even if it's assigned to another member.",Cons: It will take some amount of time to learn of it is multiple capabilities to understand what configuration and methods will work for you. The application itself can sometimes be pretty slow.

I've only had to switch over to a paid version once in several different implementations,Cons: - I wish they had stronger calendar integration (with Google Calendar) so that you could directly put tasks and meetings from Asana onto your schedule.

The ability of users to have visibility into other team members projects and timelines has helped move projects forward without the need for endless pre-planning meetings.,Cons: Varying degrees of user competency can make for a sometimes incoherent experience. This can be mitigated by customizing your dashboard.

I think its the best task manager out there.”,,8/11/2017,,Cons: I don't like that asana doesn't work with a proxy. Most of the time i have to use different IP proxies as i have to look at publishers web pages for ads from different parts of the world. To counter this i use two web browsers.

We have set up customized project templates and statuses that have helped us schedule and track jobs as well as review and archive jobs once they are finished.,10/10/2017,Pros: The ability to make special custom fields and the ability to set up email/automation to hook in with many other apps allows us to make highly customized and specific job workflows.,Cons: There is occasional downtime and since we reply so heavily on the product it can really effect workflow for that day.

Garbage in equals garbage out and this can get out of control if not monitored well. I also don't know that it would be functional for larger or intricate projects...but I also haven't used it for that, so it's tough to say for sure."

I don't even know how I functioned at work before it come along! So, thanks. There is one suggestion I have though, and that is to allow users to rank their deliverables in order of importance. For instance: when I go into MyTasks, I order my tasks by due date. But, within a particular day, my tasks don't fall in a particular order. I'd like to rank these daily tasks in order of importance so I the first thing I need to get done is at the top of the list, descending down in order of priority. Na'mean? Thanks.",4/11/2016,,

It's easy to create and assign tasks to employees and make sure everything is finished in a timely manner.

The team is more efficient and more knowledgeable due to the ease of information sharing.,3/11/2016,Pros: Very easy to use and training is simple.,Cons: I wish the text formatting was in the text window instead of having to use keyboard shortcuts.

We've also started using forms to submit projects and think it could be really valuable to make sure we have all information needed to start working on a task.,Cons: It would also be helpful to be able to assign more than one person to a project without using subtasks. Also want to be able to pick and choose more which tasks are billable vs non-billable.
1350,1350 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,3,3,,,5,“Useful with a Learning curve”,Overall: Main use to assign due dates to sub tasks to a large team.

Crafting new cards, editing, and moving them between respective columns of completion is easy. Further, many side details can be added signifying members, due dates, additional files, and more.","Cons: Overall, functionality work fantastic. That said, sometimes moving cards can be slow, especially when the selected card needs to be scrolled over to a different section of the board that is non-visible to the actual user due to screen size. Additionally, board may look cluttered with the amount of information visible. I wish I could hide all card photos unless I click on the card specifically, for example."

It's proven to be very simple to deploy and for new users to get used to.",Cons: Price. The price can get rather hefty if you have a lot of users as well if you are billed monthly.

This number doesn't change when I open old messages or receive new messages. It's impossible to tell at a glance whether I have an actually new new ping. 2) Desktop and mobile: I work with a couple different clients that use Asana. When I'm logged in with one client, I can't be logged in with the other. Asana lacks the ease of switching workspaces that Slack has. This makes my coordination of meetings and tasks require extra steps. 3) Desktop and mobile: Integration with my Google calendar worked for awhile, but stopped working, which makes scheduling meetings and tasks a chore."

This is now my preferred project management software.,9/4/2020,"Pros: Asana has an excellent user interface and features. I love that I can toggle between lists, kanban boards, and Gantt charts. Excellent for project management and handling multiple work flows across a team.","Cons: I still need to figure out best way to optimize toggle between projects and daily to-do lists.

I use the ""my task"" feature daily to plan my ""must-do"" and map out my time management across each day.","Cons: I find that it's difficult to find tasks/projects that are marked completed. Unless you remember what they were titled and can search, this component feels clunky. I also find that if the due date is set for a range, on the ""my task"" list you may not see it until, woops - it's due date!"

It's then easy to see how much time has been spent in total on each client, as well as weekly summaries of how I and other team members spent their time.","Cons: One item I miss is the lack on a monthly summary report. It has the total time spent when I go on the weekly view, but on the monthly view it only shows a calendar-like display of the month with the time worked each day, but there is no total for the month."

It wasn't hard to adapt as I've previously used multiple other similar tools, but some quirks that I mentioned continued to bug me. As with every other product of this kind - give it a test and see how it does on a daily basis. If it suits your workflow - pricing and the rest isn't all that important.",14/12/2019,Pros: + Multi-platform. Fast and easy to use both on desktop and mobile and the sync is quick and reliable. + Easy to create your own nook in an organizational structure so you can remove or filter the tasks for focus. + Customizable to your own liking. Either a list or column view for a project depending on your needs and preferences is a nice touch.,"Cons: - Even after using it for almost a full year I can't get my head around multiple levels of nesting that is available. Task upon a task in another task can get confusing and get you lost. - Likewise, opening a task and going into a subtask, then finding a delete option that annihilates the mother-task is counter-intuitive and the only option for a subtask deletion is a keyboard shortcut."

The work process is clear and simple.

You can duplicate projects and set up recurring tasks. This is extremely helpful when managing 20+ accounts per analyst.","Cons: A few times the software is offline for a few hours, which can slow us down from time to time.

The customer support is also great! I believe it's the best for the manager to get a bigger picture of the overall work being done, all in one place - who is working on which all modules, what are the deadlines, when the work is completed and approved. Personally I like the fact that how intuitive and easy it is to use this tool organise my work and the support it provides to integrate almost everything.","Cons: For an individual it's not really possible to view all the tasks in one place for an individual workspace.

This software has a ton of options and a lot of functionality, but you don't have everything. For users who don't need Asana for anything other than keeping track of tasks at a low level can use it that way. This also makes it pretty friendly for users just starting out. For more experienced users, this is a powerful piece of software when you look under the hood a little. The collaboration potential is unparalleled.","Cons: I don't love that the company feels like it needs to update the UI ever so often, even when it doesn't make things better. They're got a great product, and I get that they have software developers on staff that need to do things but it's already a great piece of software. Updating the interface just confuses things."

I like that it gives you both the Gantt chart version as well as list view and traditional calendar views.","Cons: I wish that it had a better integration with gmail so that I could just tag emails to a board w/out having to go through a tedious process of selecting the project, etc. I haven't been able to figure out how to do automatic workback schedules/templates."

It's so great to have a way to assign tasks and make sure everyone on the team stays on point.,9/2/2019,Pros: It's very easy to use and very easy for my teams to catch on to how to use it.,Cons: It's one of those products that it's hard to get other people on your team to use. It really works but you have to make sure the rest of your team is on board to use it as well.
1403,1403 Asana,Asana,Kristi P.,Chief Do-Gooder,Public Relations and Communications,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Easy and free to use!”,"Overall: I've been using Asana for probably close to two years, and love it. I've recommended it to many people, and know of lots of other businesses who use it and love it as well.

Very cool tool.",16/1/2019,Pros: The price (free!).

1404,1404 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,4,,,8,“It's decent for project management”,Overall: My experience with Asana is fairly positive. I'm not a heavy user but it does help give visibility to my other team members on what I am working on and the details. I mainly use it as a task list keeper on my part of the project. Project managers may have a different view on this.,15/1/2019,"Pros: It's easy to add a task for the team to see. For each task, there is more than enough ways to add information and detail. I like this part because sometimes a team member doesn't give much detail and just updates an item with hardly any information. When that happens, we request more info. Each member can add their own tasks and maintain what they need to do. It's almost like a checklist. The colors are great and not overbearing. I like the look and easy to jump into. It's easy to make comments on the projects and talk to each other.","Cons: It took a minute to figure out that each task can have subtask. Once when I did, it was great but wasn't sure how to go back to the previous task list. I kept looping back to the main page of the project and go from there. Other than that, I was able to figure it out."

I like its interactive interface and design. Moreover its ability of navigating easily from one part of application to another is amazing indeed. The most appreciable feature of this product is that it has played a significant role in simplifying the process of writing letters of recommendation. It is the most wonderful product for managing projects ranging from small to medium sized teams.,"Cons: Writing about cons, I would say I like the free version of Asana the most but one of the drawbacks is that the free version lacks some researching and reporting capability. Other than that I love almost each and everything about Asana."

I love that you can see your team member's work and add tasks to their dash",Cons: I dislike that you can't share a joint task. Like me and someone else have the same workload but only one of us needs to do it so if one person marks it complete the other no longer sees the task. It should also have a history of when the last time it was marked complete and by who for tracking.

They've also added a ton of personality into the product which makes it more fun than just using a notepad (narhwals and unicorns) and timeline visualization, task assignment, etc","Cons: Not great if using as a personal task management software, as it still requires a lot of manual moving items around, adjusting them, etc. Becomes more work than it's worth as you could just use a notepad (even though wasting paper is not cool)"

We are able to track the development of a project and it's current phase. Definitely recommending it.,9/10/2018,"Pros: When working online for a virtual company, Asana has been very helpful to keep track of the tasks. Creating projects, assigning members for these projects, and prioritizing the tasks has been features I love in it. We can comment under the projects, set deadlines and once a task is over assign it to someone else. Maintaining multiple projects and still being able to view each individual tasks are","Cons: I have never got the hang of asana notifications system or chat messages. It is me frequently checking in, or seeing the notifications in my email that brings it to my notice."
1417,1417 Asana,Asana,Denise C.,AmeriCorps member,Primary/Secondary Education,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Keep Your Projects and Work Life Organized and Assessable”,"Overall: I have found Asana to be a great collaboration tool! It has made large projects so much more manageable and keeps us on track without missing key ""to do's.""",5/10/2018,Pros: I really like the Board view for Projects. This way of looking at and organizing projects combines the benefits of a Kanban board with the practicality and logic of many simpler apps but with the ability to include teammates (both inside and outside the organization) for ease of collaboration. The constraints of working with spreadsheets is avoided (I cannot accomplish what I need to do working with SmartSheets without a lot of work).,"Cons: Not many. I do supplement Asana with a simple ""to do"" list in another because I can be lured into spending too much time organizing my own lists (this is a personal issue, not a software one)."

I have been using it for several years and my clients find it very user friendly and easy to use and easy to keep up with. I have clients that will go in and upload whatever is needed and know that I receive the notifications, plus they can use the app and get notified on the go about what is being done on their projects as well.",6/9/2018,"Pros: I love that I can invite my clients to the specific project that we are working on together yet they can't see what else I have going on in my business. They can add tasks for me, see progress, make comments, upload files and do so much with this software to help us both stay organized and on task.",Cons: That you have to use a seperate program to track time. I wish that was built right into Asana and you didn't need anything else.

1422,1422 Asana,Asana,Brad H.,Co-Founder/Chief Janitor,Restaurants,2+ years,5,5,5,,,,“My favorite Project Management Software”,,26/7/2018,,"Cons: Asana is set up the way I would ask for a project management software to be set up, but many of the features I think I want I haven't been able to get myself to use consistently. So it's actually more of a behavioral issue that I'm not sure anyone has cracked the code on."

Not very innovative, though”",,24/7/2018,,"Cons: - Support is slow and the product development seems even slower. - The premium features are not flexible and the price gets inflated very quickly. - The mobile app often has problems syncing and sending notifications. - The support is slow, even for premium members."

Asana is likely the best project management tool I have used at eliminating counterproductive emails chains, which is one of the most common complaints I hear across industries.","Cons: Some new users will likely end up sending too many notifications to too many team members at first since setting are powerful but easy to overuse at first, but this excess of notifications is quickly worked out after a few projects."

It is possible to try it in its free version, although with limitations when it comes to its members, so if your organization requires interacting with many people, the paid version is recommended, which will give you more benefits, since it can cover many of your expectations, in this way, store the most important information and synchronize it with other storage and information management platforms, even with your emails.","Cons: It would be very useful to be able to visualize all your tasks in one place, that is, when grouped by work sectors, I have not found a way to visualize all the tasks in the multiple workspaces. Although it has the function to remember upcoming tasks, as well as alerts to keep up with the other participants."
1427,1427 Asana,Asana,Jeffrey A.,Marcom Manager,Unspecified,2+ years,4,3,5,5,3,7,“A Great but Moderately Pricey Management App ”,,6/7/2018,,"Cons: If you didn't sign up a few years ago when the prices were a bit more competitive, you'll end up paying more than it's worth. And even if you're locked in at an earlier, cheaper rate, you can't add any more users to that price point. Adding anyone new causes your premium to shoot up."

Work gets delegated and completed.,5/5/2018,Pros: The integrations with other crucial business software and intuitive use is what really makes Asana stand out from its competitors. Have been using for small team projects to large-scale cross-functional teams and it just makes getting work done on-time.,Cons: The sub-level tasks and replies within tasks sometimes get buried and that makes looking into tasks difficult. It would be nice if sub-tasks were highlighted or had some sort of Unread notification if a comment was left.
1431,1431 Asana,Asana,Avkash K.,CTO,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,8,“Great Project Management tools”,,4/5/2018,,Cons: By default too many email for team members. Document management can be improved. It will be great if we can deploy code to server from asana

This product is beautifully organized and I love it! It is also so easy for me to see what my team members are doing and keep up to date on projects.",Cons: It is so difficult ot convince all members of your team how great Asana is. If the new person really tries it could take a month or more to learn the ins and outs of everything.

We have changed the way we manage external projects by using Asana and have changed the way a variety of teams communicate.,18/1/2018,"Pros: It is flexible and can be used to manage a project, discuss things, create a board and more. We have been able to leverage the board functionality the best. It helps us communicate between teams, assign tasks, and track things like specific client requests and efficiency.",Cons: The standard project format could be a little more flexible. It can be difficult to manage ongoing projects using that format.

Little quality of life improvements can help you really feel on top of your workflow.",14/11/2017,Pros: Extremely accommodating for even the smallest projects. Team management is packed with helpful features and functionality. Ability to add new people to established projects is great. Web app is responsive and easy to use.,Cons: There's a missed opportunity with some of the time-tracking features to actually record hours in a way that can accumulate within the program.
1437,1437 Asana,Asana,George C.,CTO,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,,“Superb project management”,,3/10/2017,,"Cons: The only problem we've ever had is in building a task template via the API that consisted of a series of subtasks and sub-subtasks.

Collaborating is so simple",8/8/2017,"Pros: You can do a lot for free! I really enjoy how easy it is to both manage my tasks and collaborate with my team. It's simple to add tasks, followers, project boards, and lists. Daily reminder emails ensure I don't have anything slip through the cracks.","Cons: I only have some minor hang-ups with it. It can be frustrating to hit enter and automatically be given a new task line that I then have to go delete, rather than just confirming the title of my task."

We have been able to do exactly that with Asana. My inbox was getting out of control and projects can be difficult to manage when there are 10+ happening simultaneously. Asana groups and categorizes tasks in a logical way that lets me get more done every hour of every day.,3/11/2016,Pros: Easy to figure out and implement quickly.,Cons: Some comments and additions to projects trigger more emails than should be necessary in my mind.

I'm even starting to use it for projects outside of work",3/11/2016,"Pros: Ease of use, 3rd party app integration, multiple projects, captures history of events that have been completed","Cons: clunky to relate projects & tasks, somewhat slow to refresh.

After ~10 months of actively using it, I can say it has made an incredible impact on the creative department for my company. It is much easier to track and manage projects. Updating the team using this tool is more effective than it was to print and email assets in development from concept to completion. I find I email less, which is a huge help and has even helped keep large files off our email server.",3/11/2016,"Pros: Ease of use, mobile app is awesome, visual layout and keeps all progress within this tool and off email.",Cons: I would like the ability to add more customization to the interface color.

Asana makes my life so much easy by providing an intuitive task management, project tracking and collaboration tool. I like how simple it is to create a new project, add the collaborators, set up the steps and its deadlines, and finally track its progress. I definitely recommend it","Cons: There are some limitations on creating and tracking more complex projects. Usually, the projects must be linear as Asana doesn't support a full Gant formatted project that involves more complex flows. However, it does the job for 95% of my needs."

We are a very busy healthcare software startup so anything that helps keep me organized is appreciated.,6/10/2020,"Pros: Our team works completely remote and Asana makes it easy to assign task to everyone. Then we can collaborate on projects, easily send updates and assign due dates. Asana keeps everything so organized and I like that you can sort tasks by different areas of importance like due date, project, priority, etc.",Cons: The task creation box is not super user intuitive and should have better labels.

You have the flexibility to create separate projects and track subtasks, assign to other team members, make projects private or visible to team. I like the different options to view my project - line items by task or visual cards.","Cons: It's very time consuming to set up a project and enter tasks. My other team members complain that it's confusing, so I have to train them even though I, personally, don't find it confusing or hard to use."

Once a week, I'd meet with all of my sales reps and we'd have different sections filled out - along with who was responsible for each. This helped both parties stay accountable.",20/8/2020,"Pros: I liked the easy, intuitive set up features. It's great to be able to check things off a list and then be able to track those down the line.","Cons: There was a level of inflexibility and clutter with the end user interface.

Last 6 months Asana fully rebuilt and everything went downside from there.,"Cons: Where to start even! Let's start with SECRETELY changing pricing for customers without notifying them! The pricing in some cases (like in mine) more than doubled. No notification, no message, just secretly changed price. Then there's new UX. It's terrible - they changed everything from one click to now at least 2 or 3 clicks to get anywhere. Accessibility was thrown out the window and now you can't do a thing without a keyboard. The look and feel is terrible now and usability - you just can't use it. It was a great software 6 months ago and I'm not sure what 's changed but now stay away! It's terrible."

Beautiful UI and nice UX makes it a pleasure to use as well.,Cons: We use the free version so don't get the benefit of dependable tasks on projects. We are happy enough with the free software so this isn't a massive negative.

It is also a great way for us to maintain accountability within the company as well.,7/5/2020,Pros: It is very intuitive and user-friendly. It was the only project management software our company has utilized that has gotten full buy in from the staff.,"Cons: There are a few functions that we wish this software had, such as e-mail integration, so we would be able to send and track e-mails that are relevant to specific projects."
1465,1465 Asana,Asana,Bryan K.,Director of Production,Food & Beverages,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“Asana keeps me on track”,"Overall: Asana is very great overall. I do a lot of many types of tasks, and without a task management software it can become overwhelming.",25/4/2020,"Pros: Easy to make projects, tasks, and subtasks. It is super efficient to assign tasks to yourselves and others.","Cons: Tagging other members of the teams can be useful, but it is often not noticeable when people tag you in tasks without having many notifications."
1466,1466 Asana,Asana,Bonny C.,Marketing and Business Development Coordinator,Events Services,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,“Taskmaster”,"Overall: Asana lets our Admin see what work is being done when. If a deadline is pushed, we can update the team with project status. We have weekly check ins and all can manage their workload as needed.",16/4/2020,Pros: Asana keeps my projects on track. The software is easily portable and I can delegate duties and deadlines from my phone if I want to. The variety of unpaid features are multiple compared to other platforms.,"Cons: It would be interesting to integrate other programs openly, like incorporating google paper for brainstorming sessions with team members in your projects."
1467,1467 Asana,Asana,Rita H.,Director of Marketing,Hospitality,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Great platform to manage projects and keep your team organized. ”,Overall:,8/4/2020,"Pros: The platforms free plan is very robust. It helps small teams with a low budget. There are also a ton of plug ins and integrations, for example Salesforce.","Cons: As this is a very robust tool, the projects can become very complex. Sometimes the tasks are limiting and only allows to assign to one person."
1468,1468 Asana,Asana,Alex B.,Account Director,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,,,10,“Collaborative dream”,Overall: Really positive - very little down time and people can use it how they wish rather than in one fixed way.,19/3/2020,"Pros: The flexibility and ease of adding / removing functions and fields is great. Really easy, consistent way of working with colleagues.","Cons: Would be good to have some 'client safe' sharing functions - particularly around project plans, without having to use Instagantt"
1469,1469 Asana,Asana,Chase B.,Tech Support Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“It keeps our Company organized”,Overall: Our company has really enjoyed using Asana in our day to day operations because it helps us keep all our tasks in one place as well as allows the various departments to coordinate on a task with each other when necessary.,19/2/2020,Pros: The user interface is so simple to use while still being fully featured.,"Cons: Until the all various features that make Asana cool are discovered, the product doesn't seem to do much"
1470,1470 Asana,Asana,Rosalinda H.,HRBP Ice Cream & Food Solutions Divisions,Retail,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,8,“Good detail”,,29/1/2020,,"Cons: Technical support is slow. We have already stopped contacting it, because to solve the problem on our own most often it turns out faster than waiting for an answer for a few days."
1471,1471 Asana,Asana,ARTHUR V.,Manager,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,5,5,1,,1,“NO LIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT”,Overall: Software is excellent BUT if you have any technical difficulties you are shut down.,14/1/2020,Pros: Did everything I wanted it to. It organized it in a reasonable manner.,"Cons: NO LIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT. The ""techs"" that ""chat"" with you are taking multiple customers at a time, my computer screen was timing out in the time it would take to get a response. They are not techs, they will chat with you for a few minutes and refer you to email customer support. I do know that I can trust my companies operations to level of customer support. Also when chatting with customer support it requests a business size in employees, which means more than likely unless you have a larger organization you are not a priority( more than 50 employees). Right now no response from support. Over two hours."

It is also works well when you need to share tasks with others.,"Cons: We often have similar tasks for reoccurring projects. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find a solution to expedite the process or copy templates."
1473,1473 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“The best project management platform we've used”,Overall: Asana is our project management solution. We wouldn't start any project without the platform.,9/12/2019,"Pros: We use Asana everyday. From the ease of use to it's mobile app, the platform has changed the way we start and finish each of our projects.",Cons: The platform would be even better if it included more robust timeline capabilities without having to integrate third party apps.

It has helped increase out team productivity.,5/12/2019,Pros: Asana has helped us organize our projects for years now. We love to manage our projects there and it helps in team management.,"Cons: Other than sometimes the weird lag in the software, we dont have any issue. we love the new updates that were made in the last few months."
1475,1475 Asana,Asana,Simon B.,CTO,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,4,5,3,8,“Asana is a great tool for small businesses but...”,Overall:,5/12/2019,"Pros: The project nature and different ways of viewing projects (lists, boards, calendar) allow for differing ways of working. Love the assignment and notification features.",Cons: Some features that should be in the free version (like being able to see the number of items in a list) are not there to Ryan and up sell a bigger feature (progress tracking). This seems to indicate that Asana knows their paid for tiers don't truly hold enough value to small businesses for the price offered
1476,1476 Asana,Asana,MATTHEW W.,Tech Manager,Health,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,“Exceptional project management software tool”,Overall:,3/12/2019,"Pros: I like being able to create multiple projects and adding different staff to each applicable project. We have various teams who all interact on larger projects, but also still manage smaller projects for our teams. Asana allows us to properly organize without overwhelming everyone.","Cons: I don't have any negative feedback to provide. It was easy to learn how to use, and if you make a mistake, everything is easily correctable."
1477,1477 Asana,Asana,Christina M.,Managing Editor + Art Director,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Love the back end and the view options”,Overall: I have recommended this to several other clients who are struggling with other similar sites. The overall 'monthly' calendar view is what wins most over.,6/11/2019,"Pros: I really like the fact that I can see a monthly view and the simplicity of setting up 'things due' or see upcoming things on a calendar. A lot of other project management systems don't offer this. AND, on top of that they have a board view that is nice so I can set up projects several different ways (per person, per time, per area like advertising, pr, marketing, sales) It had multiple options and functions that are easy.","Cons: Notifcations are easy to miss, and of course using the free version so some things are limited."
1478,1478 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Accounting,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Best Task Manager!”,Overall: Each job has a dedicated chat that also allows for clear communication that is identifiable per job. Communication capability is on point,24/10/2019,"Pros: The best feature is being able to easily assign tasks and upload files. For my clients, each task may need several working documents per task. Their system keeps me organized","Cons: The least thing that I like about this is only a minor grievance. From the home screen, the heading of the page is for Upcoming Tasks Due. While this is a great feature, I would also prefer a reminder of any tasks that are Overdue."
1479,1479 Asana,Asana,Brenda H.,Human Resources Manager,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,8,“A good collaborating program”,"Overall: A good alternative to keep the whole team tidy and well organized, I recommend it for small to medium teams",10/10/2019,"Pros: Organizing and optimizing tasks, managing to integrate all areas in the same process","Cons: Sometimes it is necessary to implement codes and we use repositories for the code, it would be great if they had integrations with those repos so that we can have better the trace of each task"
1480,1480 Asana,Asana,Keith E.,Web Developer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Great for collaborating with clients ”,Overall:,30/9/2019,"Pros: Ease of use, collaboration with clients and being able to keep track of outstanding tasks. Subtasks are great for breaking down a single task. They have tried to make it really easy for new users to be proficient by having good starter templates and examples of how to use it.",Cons: Can't assign tasks to multiple users. Bit of a downside in dev team but you can get around by mentioning the user in comments.
1481,1481 Asana,Asana,Tyas P.,Student,International Affairs,2+ years,5,4,4,4,5,9,“Most Effective Task Management Tool”,"Overall: As a student, I often have difficulty organizing time for every activity and assignment that I have. Fortunately, thanks to Asana, every task can be completed without my knowledge.",28/9/2019,Pros: One feature that I like about Asana is the pleasure of making a spreadsheet list that I can use as a checklist. Apart from that the interface is easy to understand when I first used it. It is also available as a management tool that is integrated with other applications so that data sharing can be easily controlled and accessed.,"Cons: If you use Asana in your group assignments, it will be difficult if you use it as a communication tool because this tool does not / does not yet provide a means of online communication"
1482,1482 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Sporting Goods,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,"“Asana, a great project management tool for small businesses”",Overall: It's a great software! Perfect for those who need a system to continuously keep track of their projects and goals.,26/9/2019,Pros: The ability to develop a Kanban system using the board option or the good ol' fashion task list. Both are great and used in different manners.,"Cons: Not having the ability to set reminders. If there was a way to add this feature, it would be perfect!"
1483,1483 Asana,Asana,David M.,Mobile Developer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,3,5,,5,7,“Great for big project but can be little confusing”,Overall: Good but not for me. I switched to Jira thanks to dev related integration and better UX,6/9/2019,"Pros: The UI is awesome, I love the fact that you have plenty of options with every project. It allows you to create tasks, subtasks, deadlines, upload attachments, people that are responsible for a specific task and so on. It can adapt to any project",Cons: I got lost many times with it. It is maybe too big sometimes and I lose some parts of the communication with my colleagues. You must check everything really carefully so that you don't get confused with so many options.
1484,1484 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Education Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,8,“Easy way to organize and assign tasks ”,Overall: I'm impressed with asana. It helps me stay on track with my daily tasks.,2/9/2019,Pros: It allows me to keep track of my tasks and hard deadlines.

Great for collaboration.,28/8/2019,Pros: The software offers a nice platform to easy team work and team communication. Assigning tasks is very easy as well.,Cons: The search is still pretty useless. Even when using the advanced search it misses results and even returns different results on different PC's
1486,1486 Asana,Asana,Monica C.,Artist,Arts and Crafts,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“A great way to organize tasks”,,25/7/2019,,"Cons: I wish there was an option to remove a task without deleting it entirely. I like to look back at everything I have included so I have to resort to having a section titled ""deleted"" that I move it all to."
1487,1487 Asana,Asana,Ana K.,Multimedia Designer & Marketing Manager,Construction,2+ years,4,3,3,3,3,6,“Project Management Software: I've found cheaper solutions”,"Overall: Pleasant interface, great potential, but there are other (free) programs that do more and have better integrations for Project Management.",25/7/2019,"Pros: This program is great, just not for me. The UI/UX is really great, there's tons of functions and plugins that allow you to really maximize your workflow. The clean interface, Light Mode, is very appealing and makes everything look very nice. The calendar is a really nice feature.","Cons: In the Free version, the calendar application of the software is really weak. You couldn't really plan a social media calendar, because you have multiple milestones (pending, to draft, scheduled, published, etc.). You only get one affiliated ""date"" so you can't really track the lifetime of a single task. I'm not sure how this works in the paid subscription, but the free option is very limited. Also, our firewall at work makes it so I can only use this on my commercial internet connection, so I have to use a separate work station for accessing my work emails, and that's just inconvenient. I wish there was more functionality here."
1488,1488 Asana,Asana,Lauren D.,Marketing Analyst,Apparel & Fashion,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana review”,Overall: Asana has been a company saver for us,24/7/2019,"Pros: We recently started using Asana to keep our projects together and make sure we get things done efficiently. We referred to Asana and have no chance of looking back. We have improved our efficiency when it comes to completing projects in a timely fashion thanks to the help of Asana! On top of that, it is fully integrated in our Slack Channels.","Cons: Only thing that bugged us was not being able to tag multiple people to a task, but other than it has been great!"
1489,1489 Asana,Asana,Angela A.,Administrative Assistant,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,8,“Amazing PM tool.”,Overall:,24/7/2019,"Pros: Asana is the best PM tool, we use it to assign tasks across our team members. Being a Team Lead it is easier for me keep the track of assigned tasks and get them done before the due date. What i like the best about Asana is that we can add comments on the assigned task which keeps the team mates updated if we require to get some additional work done.",Cons: The only problem with Asana is that we cannot change the default task viewer permanently.

A good reference point is Microsoft Project - Mobile IOS needs improvement.
1491,1491 Asana,Asana,Irene M.,Sr Content Strategist,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Asana enables my entire work life”,"Overall: I use Asana to manage and organize all of my work tasks and collaborate with my team.

I could possibly use more templates.

Secondly its understandable nature is another bonus point. Thirdly it helps me a lot in keeping my team well organized. It is indeed excellent tool for managing projects. It has made assigning tasks to the team members incredibly easy. It is perfectly used for multiple purposes like organizing, monitoring and managing my work.",Cons: I have been using Asana for more than two years. It is very much user friendly. I have really become a big fan of it. I can't live without it now. I failed to find any single con of it.
1493,1493 Asana,Asana,Rikke N.,Junior Production Designer,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,4,,5,9,“My go to task tool”,Overall: Asana is great and my experience is good. It took some time to get all on board from our team but now we have a good way of following each others work and tasks without running into micromanagement.,7/5/2019,"Pros: I use Asana for daily, weekly or in general any kind of task. It does the job and I can create task for myself or a colleague. We can maintain other applications and remember things every time. I can get notifications on my desktop client or on my mobile phone. I can create private tasks that should not be visible to my team. It's easy to invite new team members and follow each other in case somebody is sick. The free version can do a lot and might be enough for a lot of organisations.",Cons: Everyone in the team should be ready to use it as it otherwise will loose value very fast. There's not a lot of other negative things that can be said other than the fact that it can be hard to figure out how to do repeating tasks the most efficient way. The user management could be a bit more strict with more options of what to share etc.
1494,1494 Asana,Asana,Kimberly H.,Managing Owner,Executive Office,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Best Project Management Softward I've ever used!”,"Overall: Asana has allowed me to cut down on three other programs I have used in the past. That's amazing. I always wished for a program that can do it all in one hub and I have found it. Their customer relations department is amazing and they like to make sure you have what you need with a follow up call, depending on the service you activate (I think). My representative was amazing (so sorry I can't remember her name right now). Asana is a very pro-client company.",2/5/2019,"Pros: What I liked most was the simplicity in use. I didn't have to consult the tutorials too often on my initial try. It's a super intuitive program that most people will understand without too much technical knowledge. The integrations I activated worked without any problems. I just love how the entire set up looks and feels. It's a great tool for creative type people, no matter what genre.","Cons: As of now, not too many integrations offered, but enough to be useful. Honestly, this is the least positive thing I could say. I know the integrations will come, they usually do in technology, so it's just a matter of consumers, like us, having patience."

Asana is a great tool that has been useful in tracking projects, organizing schedules for teams.The timeline feature is very useful when tracking progress is concerned.And they have also added the Gantt chart functionality which is great for managing projects.","Cons: So far, i love Asana as a tracking and collaboration tool though i realized that the free version lacks most functionalities which force one to purchase a licence."

It's so easy to get started with it with very little learning curve. It really helps with the day to day task list overall and keeping on track.,"Cons: I would have liked to see the possibility to order tasks per column on the tab view.

I know I get a little bit too excited when talking about Asana but, it has truly impacted the way I work. I love how you can create different projects and tasks and set reminders. I laugh so hard when I remember how I used to use my phone's calendars, tasks app, email app and I other apps to try to keep track of everything. But now I have one platform. Next obvious step?

The sub tasks are especially helpful.","Cons: The upgraded version was too pricey for us, otherwise we never would have left."
1512,1512 Asana,Asana,Jhonnathan M.,Freelancer,Internet,2+ years,4,4,3,4,4,8,“A quick taste of Asana.”,"Overall: I was temporarily invited to the platform by a large project I was participating in, and in my short time I made an incredible impression as I knew exactly the status of the project at all times. All the users read and saw my reports and advances every second so the work dynamics is faster than a face-to-face work, since for each movement Asana informs everyone of what is happening with each stage and level, so it is easy to be aware of everything that happens.",4/2/2019,"Pros: The first thing that surprised me at the time of using Asana was to come in and find a simply beautiful interface. This, together with many perfectly placed components helps to organize the work of every day along with all the reports that arrive continuously maintain a very optimal workflow among all the members of the project.","Cons: This can produce an annoying amount of notifications, instead of using a summary system seems to send you as much mail as possible. Some compatibilities and tools are missing in the android application and it is usually a bit heavy at the moment of organizing many groups and teams. Just a little."

Intuitive and worth the investment of time to learn how to do it.,1/2/2019,"Pros: Asana is a great tool for organizing and managing tasks and projects. I would only recommend that you know what you are doing, or have someone trained as you start to use it. If you are doing lots of projects and tasks, it can become one big cluster in a short amount of time.","Cons: If you don't know what you are doing, and don't want to take the time to learn how it works, you might as well be using sticky notes to organize your project."

It helps to be able to delegate sub-tasks and track a project through each step.,"Cons: I always have issues setting up or duplicating a previous task and making sure it copies to the correct project. This is likely just user issue, but with as many times as it happens, I would think someone could make it more user-friendly or clear how to do small things such as that."

Its simple yet ingenious structure lets you organize your tasks any way you want. The paid version adds some very useful tracking functionalities and customizations.","Cons: If your projects grow in size and complexity, the free version lacks of managing and tracking tools and you'll require the paid versions, that are billed based on the number of users, with the annual price growing very fast."

While most of the time it's used as a simple workflow tool, some of the other capabilities are truly amazing. From project timelines to multi-department touches, it's got everything you need.",Cons: Some of the additional features are not so intuitive or easy to find. Some members of our team are not as receptive to how great of a tool this is because they haven't unlocked its true potential.

I love the Android app and the desktop version. It has a beautiful interface and is easy to use.

It's hard to imagine what you can include there until you start using it.,13/12/2018,"Pros: Wow- all that stuff distracting me... get it into Asana and get back to work. Great place to manage projects, recurring tasks, reminders, and so much more. From large work projects so simply knowing that I can ignore my mail until the ""pay bills"" reminder pops up.",Cons: There is so much info out there on how to use it... it takes some time to sort through and figure out the best way for your needs!

I can assign tasks, keep staff accountable to projects and due dates as well as keep project discussions and attachments within their individual projects.",12/12/2018,Pros: The software is amazing for team communication and keeping our team on track with projects. I like the way Asana manages projects and reminds people of due dates.,Cons: The only concern might be that it's a lot to learn initially as compared to another software we looked at using called Bandcamp. Bandcamp had a more simple presentation and setup.

Also love being able to personalize to see what task I still need to work on.,12/12/2018,Pros: I love that you can access on your laptop or smart phone. The software is very user friendly and it makes it easy to assign tasks when you have multiple people in the office on the same project.,"Cons: It's a small thing, but you can't customize the background to a picture or image. That would be fun."

But I havent meant one team member that needs help to use it. Somehow the nice colors and font combination makes it a very pleaseant thing to look at, the kind of tool you want to use often. A good experience for this kind of software.",9/12/2018,"Pros: Design and functionality wise is probably project managment out there. The design makes it stand out form the competitors apps. Asana has every single functionality or integration you may need, is a fully mature solution.","Cons: For a simple project is not the best solution because is not the cheapest project management out there, is a very complete software solution with a very fair price to what it offers."

It has helped me stay really organized. I have anywhere from 10-15 clients at a time with multiple projects attached to each and Asana ensures that I don't miss anything,4/12/2018,"Pros: I love that I can create projects and boards within the project. It makes it easy to separate work and assign to different people according to task.

We use this tool to manage social media and web tasks on a 5 person team. Our team is staffed nearly 24 hours a day.,29/11/2018,"Pros: We use this tool to manage social media and web tasks on a 5 person team. Our team works in news & is staffed 18/24 hours a day, so it's important that we're all on the same page. That being said, Asana gives the ability to assign tasks & set specific due dates & times. That has to be my favorite feature.","Cons: Things can get lost - there is just so much going on in the main interface, sometimes things easily fall through the cracks. (example: you can make a task, in a task, within a task) It can be a lot"
1531,1531 Asana,Asana,Gigi J.,Communications,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,4,5,4,,,9,“Great Project Management system for Teams”,Overall: One place to track the status of all of our projects. Easy to add other team members.,27/11/2018,"Pros: I like the fact that we can coordinate our projects amongst different team members, assign tasks and see updates in a place other than our email inbox",Cons: I'd like to see more/better integration with Gmail and Google Calendar. The email integration works but is a bit clutzy to use.

Asana does not have a pronounced learning curve. It also integrates with everything (Slack, Instagantt). It has a positive ROI for our business because it allows us to complete projects on time. Asana has helped us maintain a larger number of more organized team members. It is ideal to keep files in order and share files between our team, in addition to keeping track of our tasks. I consider that it is a product with great capabilities thanks to its great user interface, making it easy to locate projects and the tasks of each project.",15/11/2018,"Pros: Asana is suitable for teams / companies / small or medium-sized departments. I like the ability to integrate with Instagantt. It is also excellent that thanks to Asana we can share files, keep files in order, generating a positive ROI because we manage to complete the projects on time.",Cons: The Asana emails generate an overload in the inbox by default. I think Asana has to mess around in this regard.
1533,1533 Asana,Asana,Cesar M.,Project Engineer,Mechanical or Industrial Engineering,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,“Remote Team Work”,"Overall: In reviewing similar applications, Asana is one of the best out there.",13/11/2018,"Pros: You can perform very effective project management, follow up on resources, gather information in a single place, so team members are able to communicate and be up to date on all project activities. The productivity increases because you can delegate tasks via e-mail, follow up and remind of uncompleted tasks.","Cons: Some of the shortcomings are addressed with add-ons in case you need them, other than that Asana keeps evolving to cover all aspects of Project Management"

It's awesome. We really like using it and it's our primary source of getting things done now.,23/10/2018,"Pros: It made communicating with my coworkers really easy. Before we were using this, we were using Facebook messenger *face palm*. It was a little difficult to figure out at first, but as soon as the team got the hang of it, it made us way more efficient in our jobs.","Cons: I don't like the price. I'm in charge of book keeping at work and I just couldn't ever justify the cost--but my employer can. It seems a little high compared to other options. But it did make us more efficient, so maybe I'm just being a stickler!"
1535,1535 Asana,Asana,Perry F.,Marketing and Communications Manager,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,7,“Asana Review”,"Overall: Asana is a clean and easy to use tool. The interface makes onboarding new users a stress-free task, and it has helped our team stay on the same page for multiple important projects.",23/10/2018,"Pros: Asana allows our team to split up various tasks of a project, see eachothers progress, and encourage completion for an on-time delivery. It is especially great for assigning tasks to my team members after a meeting and making sure that everyone is held accountable.",Cons: You are paying for a tool that can be done for free by writing a to-do list on a piece of paper.The only difference is that it is quicker to see if others have completed their tasks using asana vs finding them in the office and confirming it 'manually'.
1536,1536 Asana,Asana,Brian S.,Founder,Higher Education,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“The task management tool that works”,"Overall: Terrific - onboarding people is easy, seeing progress and task speed helps with better project planning.",17/10/2018,Pros: Thoughtfully designed to help me think about my work in a manageable way - breaking things into projects with tasks and subtasks has organized my to dos and increased productivity.,"Cons: It is tricky setting up things like creating new tasks through an email subject, but once set up it's great."

The cons are the people who don't follow-up on their tasks or mark them complete. I never tried to print a project plan but I don't know if that is even a feature as most people have easy access to web 24/7.
1540,1540 Asana,Asana,Amrita H.,Content Marketing Coordinator,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,8,“Right tool to manage your tasks and sub tasks”,Overall: I mainly use Asana to collaborate with my marketing team on big and small tasks. We add comments and suggestions to each other's tasks and manage a project collaboratively. I also use it to maintain my personal content calendar.,17/9/2018,"Pros: I love the feature of letting me make subtasks within a big task. I used to use HubSport for managing my marketing projects and now I use Asana to keep myself on track with what's coming up and keep myself on track. Also, for fun, on completing the tasks I love to see the cute unicorns coming over on my dashboard that makes me happy.","Cons: Your entire team should be able to use this software, if not, it becomes difficult for you to keep a track on their progress and add comments to their tasks."
1541,1541 Asana,Asana,Raymond A.,Communications Director,Design,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,9,“If you like to plan...”,Overall: Asana is intuitive and loaded with abilities. It is the swiss army knife of planning tools that does not require you whole team to be a part of.,13/9/2018,Pros: Very simple yet advanced in it's features.,"Cons: There is not much I don't like about the software, it is really a complete package. If I could add something, it would be the ability to drag mutiple tasks into one task without clicking on that task to add it."
1542,1542 Asana,Asana,Jessica M.,Marketing & Communications Manager,Automotive,2+ years,4,5,4,,5,8,“For those who love lists”,Overall: Asana is one of my three tabs that open when I launch Chrome first thing in the morning. I want it up right away and it stays up throughout the day. It's a very grounding tool.,4/9/2018,Pros: The layout is simple and easy to navigate. I like the ability to break apart my list to various projects and restrict who can see what.,Cons: Removing an item from a list doesn't seem natural to me. I would never think tab backspace to do it.
1543,1543 Asana,Asana,Aaron C.,Principal Consultant & Founder,Management Consulting,2+ years,4,3,3,5,5,9,“Great for small startups and freelancers”,Overall:,28/8/2018,Pros: Asana is a great tool for tracking task and to-do list for multiple projects/customers. It offers a free tier level for startups and free lancers that you can't beat with even the paid levels at some competitors. It also offers task boards for Kanban style prioritization and project management.,Cons: The tools for making build changes to tickets can be a bit clunky and it would be nice if the kanban boards could have workflows to automatically changes ticket statuses when they are moved between columns. In all these are realities minor and isn't an issue for 99% of usage.
1544,1544 Asana,Asana,Shofi A.,Owner,Health,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“Great Value when it comes to managing my Team and automating my process = More sleep time for me ”,,22/8/2018,,Cons: Little complicated in the beginning unlike one of there competitors process.st who made it super easy but the overall feature on here is a lot better and more compatible with third party softwares
1545,1545 Asana,Asana,Ariel I.,Senior Web Developer,Retail,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“Beautiful and efficient project management software”,,16/8/2018,,Cons: Until now I don't have anything negative to say about Asana. I'm very happy with the features. I was looking for something simple and not a Basecamp replacement.

Very happy with this product. Will recommend it over similar MS products. One does need to upgrade to premium to get all the team collaboration benefits. But, if your team is using Asana, then it is worth the small investment"
1548,1548 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,3,5,8,“Is the heartbeat of our company”,,10/8/2018,,Cons: I wish I didn't need to upgrade to a paid plan in order to keep boards private.

The interface also makes it very easy to manage, track and maintain different workflows and helps the team stay updates on the project status and pending tasks.","Cons: The process to manage the tasks that are currently assigned to you can sometimes get overwhelming and difficult to control. Also, I think the mobile app needs improvement as I have felt that the desktop integration is superior"
1550,1550 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Apparel & Fashion,2+ years,4,4,5,,,8,“Great project management tool!”,Overall: Great project management capabilities with good integration options that helps that team stay connected and on schedule,31/7/2018,"Pros: It is very simple and easy to create and assign tasks with Asana. The workflow is easy to understand, customizable and easily traceable to assign ownership and tracking on progress across multiple tasks. Integration with other communication software like Slack is great and helps the team stay connected and informed.","Cons: Limited options to customize notifications is one drawback that I feel the software contains. Also, the ability to have custom level of access is limited and due to this there is lack of visibility of changes that are undertaken by members of the team."
1551,1551 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Services,2+ years,4,4,3,,,7,“Great for organization and tagging of tasks; may fall short for true project management workflow”,Overall: improved efficiency and tracking,31/7/2018,Pros: I can easily tag a task with as many relevant keywords or names as I need. It's very easy for me to see what I am responsible for as well as set up custom searches. Integrates with JIRA. Adding Asana to our suite of tools has definitely improved our efficiency.,Cons: We are still using JIRA to manage software/development fixes and enhancements. Our team feels that we can use this for smaller projects but for larger efforts we may need to rely on another tool. Perhaps we could use JIRA exclusively.
1552,1552 Asana,Asana,Sara M.,Administrative Assistant,Philanthropy,2+ years,4,5,4,,,8,“Great from a the users end!”,,24/7/2018,,Cons: Asana emails can be too frequent at times. I also think that the Asana mobile app is more difficult to use in comparison to their online computer platform.
1553,1553 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,4,3,5,10,“I use it as a project tracker for my consulting work and it is great for that”,,16/7/2018,,"Cons: Multiple projects could be better handled, it isn't unintuitive, but I don't consider switching between projects obvious either. I also would like a little better handling for multiple users, specifically approval workflow options with some fine grained control but this is really nitpicking as if you need an enterprise level standalone task/bug tracker outside of git you are probably leaning towards JIRA or TFS depending on your eco-system."
1554,1554 Asana,Asana,Bryan P.,Land Acquisition Specialist,Unspecified,2+ years,5,4,4,4,,,“It is a great company organizational tool. ”,,2/7/2018,,"Cons: I do wish there'd be a ""trash"" or ""recently deleted"" folder. I've done it a few times where I accidentally deleted something and didn't catch it in time to recover."

The free version has all you need to start, the help is well thought through and I like the constant improvements they do.",Cons: It does not integrate with other software like quickbooks. I would love to see a gantt chart type of functionality.
1557,1557 Asana,Asana,Saurabh Y.,Software Engineer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,5,4,4,5,9,“Good Experience”,,7/6/2018,,"Cons: Should have more linking options like github, bitbucket, Zeplin, etc. The free version can be for more members to join and collaborate, this can be real test and can show insights of how the product will scale for hundreds members colloborating at the same time concurrently."
1558,1558 Asana,Asana,Jorden B.,Owner,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,,“Asana is among the top project management tools”,,31/5/2018,,"Cons: Honestly, I don't really have any cons with Asana. I feel its a great tool. But maybe for larger teams of people, it doesn't seem to work as well as compared to a single or several users."
1559,1559 Asana,Asana,Johnny R.,Director of Strategic Innovation,Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,,“This is the #1 tool I use and I don't think I could function successfully without it.”,,29/5/2018,,"Cons: It would be great to be able to bulk update dates, people, to tasks in Kanban views. I know there are updates all of the time, but this is one thing that would be very very valuable and key to improving my workflow."
1560,1560 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,10,"“Great product, feature-rich. Extremely useful way of organizing tasks.”",,28/5/2018,,Cons: No software is perfect and flexible enough to fill all the needs of every company. Asana might not work for certain team sizes or business models. Test it and see if it fit your needs.
1561,1561 Asana,Asana,Ryan C.,Manager,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,3,,,“I use asana daily to manage workflow for a video production company.”,,23/5/2018,,Cons: There's really not much I don't like. If I had to pick one thing it's that the interface takes a little while to get used to. But once you get it it's fine.
1562,1562 Asana,Asana,Peter S.,Co-Founder,Unspecified,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,"“Wonderful task management platform, robust but can be difficult to use if not setup properly”",,13/5/2018,,Cons: Not much when it's used properly. There's so much you can do with it that it can become unwieldy if not setup properly...then again that's not the platforms fault.
1563,1563 Asana,Asana,Jessica H.,Visual Designer,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Can't function without it!”,Overall: It helps me stay organized and on task. Plus the mobile app makes it simple to stay on track on the go.,4/5/2018,"Pros: The best thing about Asana is that it's very full featured - even at the free tier. I tried it once and gave up because I wasn't using it, but after using Trello and finding it a bit TOO stripped down, I went back to Asana. Every day I sit down and create a daily task list and check my weekly task list, and it helps me stay on track and plan accordingly. The dashboard is the best feature because it lets me know where and how I'm best using my time.","Cons: Some of the controls could be a bit more intuitive, especially when setting up the dashboard and adding specific details to projects."
1564,1564 Asana,Asana,Joan V.,VP of Marketing,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,,"“We use Asana company-wide, and we absolutely love it.”",,4/5/2018,,"Cons: No phone support, even for premium members! (Their support documentation is so excellent, we have not felt the need for phone support, but it would be nice to have.)"
1565,1565 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Retail,2+ years,5,5,5,,,,“The free tier of Asana is a wonderful task manager”,,2/5/2018,,Cons: The free tier is a little bit restricted. This is fine but the illusion of being able to use a feature is a bit annoying. You tap the feature then get a little popup telling you that it's not part of your tier. I understand why this is the case and quickly got used to it though.
1566,1566 Asana,Asana,Kelly C.,Owner,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,,“Best free tool in my online business toolbox ”,,27/4/2018,,Cons: Before I would have said the lack of a board type option but now they have that too! I honestly can't think of any other cons
1567,1567 Asana,Asana,Kate S.,Developer,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,3,3,4,6,"“Overall helpful, but lacking some basics that make task management cumbersome”",,19/4/2018,,"Cons: The inability to sort the Inbox is a glaring omission. A large portion of my inbox notifications are either other people completing tasks or tasks being added to a project that I follow, but unfortunately I can't filter to these types of things and archive them in bulk, so I end up completely abandoning the inbox as it becomes useless."
1568,1568 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Management Consulting,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Affordable Team Collaboration SAAS”,Overall: Great for collaboration with your teams,14/4/2018,"Pros: We love Asana! We use Asana to manage campaign timelines before launch, to track milestones and to collaborate amongst our team. Also Asana is perfect for personal project brainstorming and provides two areas for personal and business.","Cons: Asana is a great tool but we have found it works best when integrated with Gsuite calendar, mail, and sheets."
1569,1569 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,4,5,5,5,5,10,“Great collaboration tool”,"Overall: Time saving, staying on top of project status and keeping team communication open",13/4/2018,"Pros: Unlike other products, the free plan has all of the important features with upgrades available but not required to be able to get a lot out of the product. This is a great collaboration tool and it helps keep me organized. The support documentation so far hasn't let me down, I have always found the answer I needed so I haven't ever had to contact support.","Cons: I don't like that subtasks are not easily visible when viewing the project cards without having to click on each card. Setting up recurring tasks takes more clicks than I'd like because first I have to set the due date, then I have to click on it again to set it to repeat. You have to connect each separate project by itself to Google Calendar, if you have a lot of projects, you'll have a lot of different calendars to set up. These things can be time-consuming and the subtasks issue is a big let down for me having to force me to alternate between the project cards and the tasks list."
1570,1570 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Perfect tool for organizing marketing campaigns”,,9/4/2018,,Cons: It would be useful to be able to create lists or tasks that don't have a due date. Other than that I don't have many cons.
1571,1571 Asana,Asana,Josef M.,Accountant/Consultant,1-10 employees,2+ years,4,4,4,3,4,7,“Coordinating the office.”,Overall: This is a great affordable way to coordinate your office in one place or over a distance.,5/4/2018,Pros: Product is one of the better office and task organizing pieces of software available. I like how it stores old tasks and allows a record area for comments.,Cons: This software can seem a little cumbersome at first with fluent use of the program not entirely natural. Program understanding builds over time.
1572,1572 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,8,“Asana is good tool for task management”,,5/4/2018,,Cons: I don't always feel Asana is super intuitive. It takes a little bit to figure out the lay of the land.
1573,1573 Asana,Asana,Kayla M.,admin assistant,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,,“By far one of my favorite task organizer tools of all time”,,20/3/2018,,"Cons: The only feature I wish it had was the ability to create a calendar that is not attached to specific tasks, i.e. a calendar with large project deadlines."
1574,1574 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,4,3,4,4,4,8,“Nice app to keep your team connected.”,Overall: I get my team to work with a clear path ahead. It was relatively easy for them to use.,14/3/2018,"Pros: It's UI is beautiful. It is a nice experience just to open this app. Besides it helps your team get to work right away. Everybody knows what should do, when it should be done and who it there to help. You can follow the progress of every task and comment along side.","Cons: It is a bit tricky to let everything connects where everything should connect. If your a project manager you will probably like this app, but keep in mind it is a bit tricky."
1575,1575 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,11-50 employees,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,9,“Best project management tools for not that complex projects ”,Overall: Impression of having everything organised and under control.,21/2/2018,Pros: It is very easy to use and all team members can and love to use ot on the spot. It can literally change your live not inly in the company but at home too.,"Cons: It is very hard to find any aspects of using Asana that I don't like. If I had to choose something id go for the design, that could be even more simple and clean."
1576,1576 Asana,Asana,Megan M.,Marketing and Operations Specialist,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana has been great”,Overall:,8/2/2018,"Pros: You can easily manage tasks, create subtasks, view projects, and get things done. I like that there is the option to create different style boards - it's been really helpful with all the different projects we have. I also enjoy how easy it is to stay up-to-date on shared projects. I am loving the new option to paste images! Makes it so much easier than adding and opening attachments.",Cons: I wish the dependent tasks displayed a little differently. It's easy to get confused with those if there isn't a lot of info in the description. You really have to look to find the original task.
1577,1577 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Human Resources,2+ years,4,5,5,,,9,“Great task management tool”,,9/1/2018,,"Cons: It can be hard to get a team to adopt and use Asana exclusively. Once it's the go to place, it's awesome, but if people are still using other tools it becomes duplicative."
1578,1578 Asana,Asana,Dylan C.,Marketing Manager,51-200 employees,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,9,"“Great, lite project management tool for small teams!”",Overall: A free project management that keeps everyone together on one platform.,12/12/2017,"Pros: I love the ease of use that this system offers. You can assign out tasks, create projects, upload project scope and creep, and keep track of easy deadlines.",Cons: The software may be too lite for some enterprise accounts. It does not have a desktop app which would help with ease of use. It also isn't the best for graphic design work.
1579,1579 Asana,Asana,Harsh S.,Software Developer,10,2+ years,5,4,5,5,4,9,“Asana Review!”,,10/12/2017,,Cons: I don't like the fact that you can't assign one task to multiple people. There are certain tasks that would need collaboration and I really prefer if there's a way for Asana to make it happen.
1580,1580 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Broadcast Media,2+ years,5,5,5,,3,9,"“Easy to use, aesthetically pleasing.”","Overall: Better communication and organization around projects with multiple stakeholders, and fewer dropped balls.",7/11/2017,"Pros: Asana is a great tool for managing workflows and has a pretty easy learning curve for new users. I work at a small non-profit where staff wear multiple hats, and everyone has a role in projects. Asana helps us keep all the pieces organized.","Cons: Our organization would really like to upgrade from the free version, but it's not budget-friendly for small non-profits. I'd love for Asana to have a midrange level between free and Premium."
1581,1581 Asana,Asana,Ardalan Z.,Sr. Online Marketing Manager,Medical Devices,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,9,“Great software for those who know how to use it”,,16/10/2017,,"Cons: It could become slightly complicated if you're used to other simple productivity apps. Asana is a little different from others and therefore, you need to learn how to use it best first."
1582,1582 Asana,Asana,Stephen C.,Director of Operations,Unspecified,2+ years,5,4,5,5,,,“An ideal product with a clear message and vision”,,14/9/2017,,Cons: The integrations is where it hits my team hard. We use jira and the dev side of things because of the integral integration with GitHub. It's not really possible with Asana and really has disrupted our workfkows
1583,1583 Asana,Asana,Susan B.,"Executive Assistant, Social Media Manager",Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,4,3,5,8,“Team Task Organization with Asana”,,13/7/2017,,"Cons: It's not super user-friendly, I've been using it for a couple of years and there are a lot of features I don't use because they aren't easy to find or utilize. Also, the team doesn't always look at their assigned tasks which then get ignored and lost."
1584,1584 Asana,Asana,Gregory L.,Project Manager,Broadcast Media,2+ years,5,5,4,5,4,8,“I enjoyed using the program but it lacked a few things that we needed to help our company run smooth”,Overall: I was able to get a better understanding on how to run projects and employees.,29/6/2017,Pros: I liked how easy it was to use. It always made life easier at work. The app was fantastic and the crew new exactly what they needed on the job. They were able to update the different projects that we had going on with the app that made administration know what was always going on.,Cons: We couldn't get an overview of all of our projects at once. We had to go into every job to see where we were at. It just made things harder for us to follow everything and every employee progress.
1585,1585 Asana,Asana,Sydney G.,Inbound Marketing Manager,Unspecified,2+ years,4,5,3,3,,,“Great Tool for Getting Started with Small Teams”,,27/6/2017,,"Cons: I wish you get a lot more collaboration with the free version and more integrations options, especially with marketing automation tools (HubSpot) and other note-taking tools (Evernote) -- and sorry, third-party integrations don't count. :)"
1586,1586 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,9,“Excellent for planning and managing your tasks”,,23/5/2017,,"Cons: Asana is more suited to be used in browser, because the mobile app is not as fluid as the web interface so i don't really use it. A mobile app that would be as fast as Todoist one and which would allow you to have some custom calendar views of your tasks and project would be awesome."
1587,1587 Asana,Asana,Nathan E.,A&R Manager,1001-5000 employees,2+ years,4,3,2,,,5,“Needs more features”,,12/3/2017,,"Cons: I feel like there could be a lot more done with asana. E.G. Incorporating google docs or something like that into a project. E.G. As a music publisher, I enter details about a song for our team to then register to collect royalties etc. But I would like to create a form within ASANA so that I don't miss any details and the information is in a similar layout every time."
1588,1588 Asana,Asana,Dustin D.,,Consumer Services,2+ years,4,3,4,5,4,6,“Asana is a great company & task management tool.”,"Overall: When our company first got Asana, I really wasn't a fan of it, to be honest. Since then it has grown on me and the GUI has improved a lot over time. Asana continually strives to get better and stand out from the ground. 3rd Party apps support is also great and other tools we use integrates nicely into it.",8/2/2017,Pros: - Well Known - Great 3rd party support - Very active development,Cons: - Bit of a learning curve
1589,1589 Asana,Asana,Neosha G.,Founder,Photography,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“LOVE ASANA!”,Overall: I've been using Asana for years now and loved watching the platform grow. I use it for all of my projects and even to help me plan out content for my personal blogs and YouTube channels. Great for those who enjoy having things laid out nicely in front of them. It also makes it easy to collaborate with others.,5/1/2017,Pros: Easy to use and great for managing content creation and projects. (Works wonders for remote teams).,Cons: May be confusing at first to some.
1590,1590 Asana,Asana,Craig B.,"Coordinator, Country Services",Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Bring the Awesome”,"Overall: My team and I have been using Asana for at least a couple of years now and it has changed the way we communicate and work together. We are spread out across the state and used to be tied to emails a lot, which I hate. But now we rarely use email and the team all work together on projects in Asana.",6/12/2016,Pros: Ease of use. It's constantly being upgraded and improved. It has unicorns,
1591,1591 Asana,Asana,Jack C.,Production Manager,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,4,4,5,,,“Wonderful Workflow Management”,"Overall: Asana has revolutionized the way we work and has made it possible for us to automate and sped up various parts of our production, job checkin, and general scheduling and time management.",22/11/2016,Pros: It is a beautiful system that is relatively easy to use. The cute additions of little animations and celebratory cartoon when jobs are completed is great for general moral. It's fun and useful.,"Cons: There is some confusion about the delimitation between projects, tasks and subtasks. I would like to ability to group projects into folders and in general have more options for customization."
1592,1592 Asana,Asana,Bryce B.,Lead Social Designer,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“My Go-To Task Management Software”,"Overall: I've been using Asana for several years now. From different companies to different teams. Anytime I make a transition I encourage the use of Asana for transparency of tasks across teams and keep track of progresses. The new board feature is the one missing feature but now that it's here, I couldn't be happier.",17/11/2016,"Pros: transparency, ease of use, and customization",Cons: I wish subtasks and digger deeper in the product tasks wasn't so buried.
1593,1593 Asana,Asana,Brett N.,Graphic Designer,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Love Asana”,Overall: Asana is a great tool for us here at Costa Vida. We use it primarily in our marketing department to organize incoming partner and internal creative requests. We also use it to interface with some of our vendors to keep them in the loop on projects that we collaborate with them on.,10/11/2016,Pros: Easy interface that allows for shuffling of projects and ability to assign dates and times.,Cons: I wish that there were a built in system to track projects (i.e. a built in system similar to Harvest). Where projects can be tracked in real time and invoiced and billed if needed.
1594,1594 Asana,Asana,Charlie C.,Visual Designer,11-50 employees,2+ years,4,3,4,4,4,8,"“Great software, but too many hidden buttons ”",Overall: The button icons are not labeled and it's hard to understand what they all do. An example of this is when you edit a project using the pencil button and it then turns into a plus sign. I didn't realize the button changed to now perform a different task (adding the task to a different project.),8/11/2016,Pros: The design is clean and I'm able to skim the page easily.,Cons: It can be hard to organize tasks when you have a large group editing a project. I think sometimes I get lost within subtasks for subtasks.
1595,1595 Asana,Asana,Ciprian C.,Product Owner Marketing Technology,Hospitality,2+ years,4,5,4,5,4,9,“Good project management tool”,"Overall: We switched to asana from our previous project management tool and all in all it was a good decision. We can easily keep track of projects, deadlines, tasks and deliverables from multiple teams. Also, the recent addition of custom fields allows for a full customization to meet each team`s/department`s needs. To be honest, I don`t know how customer support works for them. I never needed them as it`s really easy to use.",7/11/2016,Pros: Easy to use with a clean and intuitive interface. Great customization options to meet each team`s needs.,"Cons: Mobile app could be better, but real progress was made there in the past months so I think this con will be outdated soon."
1596,1596 Asana,Asana,Casey W.,CEO,Sports,2+ years,5,3,3,4,5,8,“Life changing for me ... yet *hard to get people on board”,"Overall: We learned that until we committed, it wasn't getting used. Still way too easy to use the inbox. We try to use asana for communication, there are just soooo many tasks and projects that it gets lost. I LOVE asana, and highly recommend it, but I've had trouble getting people on board. It has SO much functionality, that it becomes really overwhelming fast. My recommendation would be an intake form or company questionnaire of some sort that would customize an on-boarding process. I would be happy to pay for that.",3/11/2016,"Pros: The 'why' behind it. It's like a ""middle brain"" that brings together the left and the right.","Cons: hard to find things, communication is difficult because there are so many different places to do it."
1597,1597 Asana,Asana,Daniela S.,Business Partners Manager,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,5,4,3,5,8,“For work or for life”,"Overall: In my office we use it to coordinate proyects. All activities are known and it is easy to search for information. Buy I also have my personal account which I use of daily chores, or activities, that require more information than just the name of the chore (images, links, etc), and that may require a follow up.",3/11/2016,"Pros: It is really easy to use. It has extra features that I keep finding, that makes it more interesting.","Cons: That when someone ckecks it (closes it), that person is the only one that gets the credit for the task, evern thugh sometimes you just return the task so the other person receives the information of the task."
1598,1598 Asana,Asana,Daniel R.,Interaction Architect,Computer Software,2+ years,5,3,4,,,7,“Almost there for software project management”,"Overall: We use Asana for managing our software project which consists of a web service and a mobile app. We've appreciated the new features such as custom fields. We do find it cumbersome that for every sprint we have to create a new project and we have to copy over our custom fields. It's also a pain that the custom views don't support persistent sorting and filtering by the custom fields and that the custom fields don't show up in people centric (""My Tasks"") views. Sub-tasks are not well implemented in that they are confusing and hard to track. We also need ways of assigning tasks to multiple people and ways of saying two tasks are related (but not dependent).",3/11/2016,Pros: performance (when it's good). can edit text fields anywhere; drag and drop.,Cons: performance (disconnecting); custom fields not fully supported; doesn't work well for sprints
1599,1599 Asana,Asana,Brian W.,Sr. QA Eng.,Computer Software,2+ years,3,4,1,3,1,0,“It's not very good for IT teams needing more technology under the hood”,"Overall: Some teams use Asana for project management and perhaps it's good for that. For me I feel it isn't very useful for technology teams. We can't paste code, we have no auto integration with build processes like Jenkins and it's incredibly slow to wait 5 seconds to load each asana task. It's not easy to pass around a task #... as Asana creates these long tokens for every task. Several of us have asked for these features on Twitter with the Asana team and we just are told it's not something that they're interested in adding.",3/11/2016,Pros: I guess it's an easy interface to make a task,"Cons: It really doesn't offer what Jira or other software packages offer... there's no enforced flow for bug / defect tracking, there's no easy way to pull tickets up (i.e. it's not a simple task identifier such as CR4478, instead it's a 20 character random string. When you pull up an individual task it takes nearly 5 seconds to load it, and you get the Asana splash screen while you wait. You can't easily put code into the Asana tasks. Asana doesn't have 3rd party API connecting (like Jira) to automatically link to Jenkins or other products. As a defect tracking system it's entirely lacking. This may not be what you intended it to be used for, but that's how we use it (for everything) and it's incredibly lacking. We have to be creative with Asana to make it sorta work and it's still not very appealing from the QA or Dev side of things."
1600,1600 Asana,Asana,Bri L.,Marketing Project Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,5,5,5,5,7,“Keeps Things Organized”,Overall: I enjoy checking things off my to-do list. It makes me feel like I've accomplished something in my work day. Asana makes it easy to group my tasks by project which really helps with productivity. It's also a great way to keep my team on track and organized. I'm able to see their progress on their tasks.,3/11/2016,"Pros: You can sort your tasks by project, due date, etc. You can create subtasks of a task that details how to finish that particular task. You can see tasks that have already been completed. You can view other people's tasks",Cons: Slow load times Sudden crashes Task duplication takes a long time.
1601,1601 Asana,Asana,Carlee D.,Meeting & Event Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,4,5,5,10,“Asana is great for Meeting Planning projects!”,"Overall: Our team uses Asana to track the sourcing, contracting and planning of our company's internal meetings. It really helps us stay on track so we can offer a high level of customer service to our internal clients and allows for transparency on our team so we can help each other when someone is out of the office.",3/11/2016,"Pros: The short-cuts are helpful, all the tagging and categorizing options are a big help. Also the flying unicorns make for a good laugh on a busy day.",Cons: It would be great if there was a way to quickly assign another person to a bunch of your tasks or bulk assign yourself to a bunch of tasks at one time in a project.
1602,1602 Asana,Asana,Chelsea L.,Creative Director,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,4,4,,10,“Using Asana for Work”,"Overall: Handling a ton of accounts, Asana has been a life-saving platform to contain all of our projects, files, information, etc. It has saved us time, money, and especially with deadlines. I believe I am a very organized person so Asana has been very addicting, I use it personally now to keep my weeks straight",3/11/2016,Pros: Asana works very fast and I love that it is live time. Because everything can be extremely compartmentalized I can handle a much larger workload,Cons: that clients can delete photos/files you upload- it has created some stressful situations. I wish we could upload more than 100mb again as well but I understand why that was lowered
1603,1603 Asana,Asana,Brian B.,Senior Marketing Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,4,3,5,9,“Perfect for our creative agency!”,"Overall: I manage a small creative agency (12 on the team) and we've been using Asana for six months to manage multiple clients with numerous projects. My team hated using our old project management system and I had to force them to enter projects. With Asana, not only do they use tool to track the tasks involved with a project, but all conversations, files and links are included! And, with the handy app, we are all in touch... all the time. Plus, unicorns. I mean, how cool is that?",3/11/2016,Pros: The ease with which I can see where every project stands.,"Cons: I can't think of any off-hand. The app could be a little more intuitive, I guess."
1604,1604 Asana,Asana,Camila F.,Operations Assistant,Retail,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,10,“Perfect for work”,"Overall: I use it daily to communicate with my work colleagues about projects and tasks, I find it useful that you can have private tasks as I tend to leave a lot of reminders for myself which obviously not everyone else wants to or needs to see. I couldn't think of a more perfect tool - way better than a simple to-do list",3/11/2016,"Pros: Being able to easily share information, e.g. files that are relevant to a task so they are not lost","Cons: The tiniest thing, whenever you want to tag someone it brings up the tasks - which is fine however it changes position on the page so by the time I move my mouse and click on the person name that I want to tag, I end up tagging a task by accident. Seems to occur a lot with my colleagues too!"

One of our employees made an Asana tutorial and sent it out to everyone which really helped me b/c it was simplified in comparison to the Asana tutorial online. Once I got the swing of things, Asana is much easier to use and now I fly through tasks."
1606,1606 Asana,Asana,Austin J.,Marketing Operations Specialist,Information Services,2+ years,4,5,4,,,10,“User for 5+ years”,,23/10/2020,,Cons: The connection lost notifications are a bit of a bummer. I feel like multiple times a day I need to refresh the tab or I can't update tasks.
1607,1607 Asana,Asana,Keri K.,Marketing Director,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,9,“Great tool for task tracking”,Overall: We have had a great overall experience with Asana. The rollout to employees went well and it is very user friendly so there have not been many issues.,14/10/2020,"Pros: We like that you have a clear picture of tasks employees are working on, how they were assigned, and how it relates to each company we work with. It can be as detailed or as undetailed as you make it.","Cons: Assigning tasks when we work with over 200 companies can be tedious, but once it is set up it is much more user friendly. It was just a lot of work upfront."
1608,1608 Asana,Asana,Hannah C.,Office Manager,Hospitality,2+ years,5,5,4,,,9,“Great collaboration tool”,"Overall: Doesn't work as a source of general company information, but it's a great collaboration tool to use for individual projects.",7/10/2020,Pros: Asana works wonderfully as a collaboration tool with multiple people on the same project. The ability to create a web of smaller tasks within larger ones and to assign each to someone different allows for a high level of organization.,"Cons: There are no accurate reporting tools for tracking project completion or total tasks/projects completed, and tasks can easily get lost in the sea."
1609,1609 Asana,Asana,Chan P.,Pastor,Religious Institutions,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“Good Collaborative Task Manager”,Overall: Asana has been helpful for staying on track with tasks. You can integrate it with Slack which is also helpful.,6/10/2020,Pros: It's easy to separate different projects and assign the right people to the right assignments all in one place.,Cons: It's not necessarily the nicest looking software and it can feel a little clunky. The notifications on the app could also be better.
1610,1610 Asana,Asana,Elizabeth L.,Communication Manager,Religious Institutions,2+ years,5,5,5,,,8,“Team Project Management at its finest ”,Overall: Positive! It works great for a team setting like I said.,24/9/2020,Pros: Asana works great for teams and staying on top of projects. The reminder emails are helpful and the way you can update notes on one item with multiple people is great.,Cons: I would love the information to be more in front of my face - can notifications be enabled in a browser?
1611,1611 Asana,Asana,Katrina L.,Wildlife Biologist,Environmental Services,2+ years,4,4,4,,,7,“Easy project and task tracking”,"Overall: I found it useful to be able to track all the tasks and due dates associated with the projects I was involved with. The biggest challenge was keeping up with updating projects and tasks as they were completed/added. Only several staff members were using this software, so it wasn't as useful overall for the entire company. I think if a company commits, from the top down, to use this software consistently, it would be very useful for tracking, organizing, and prioritizing work, and could be a hub for project management, but everyone involved in the projects must use the tool regularly for it to work well.",22/9/2020,"Pros: I like the ability to create projects, tasks, and subtasks, each with check-marks, and be able to leave comments for each task/subtask, as well as assign tasks and due dates to different team members. I also like that you can view a list of your personal tasks that were assigned to you.",Cons: I think sometimes even having the task and subtask made things a bit over-simplified. Perhaps this was just us needing to figure out how to best use the software to get the most out of it. I'm sure there are a lot of features we could have used but didn't.
1612,1612 Asana,Asana,Emin N.,Customer Relations and Sales assistant,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,5,4,4,4,8,"“A helpful software for communications, tracking and collaboration”","Overall: With Asana, you can plan your projects according to your priorities. Tracking feature helps to do an effective work and also check your previously done jobs to analyze. This software makes team colleagues to collaborate and communicate very closely and sufficiently. Despite there are some disadvantages, I believe they will solve them in further updates.",17/7/2020,"Pros: 1) Colleagues can be aware of real time updates via Collaboration tools. In case, all kinds of tasks get completed or there is any issue related to a task, Asana send you notifications. 2) The integration functionality of Asana is very useful. Due to my personal experience, I integrated to Microsoft and Zoho softwares. 3) In comparison with different softwares, I find the design of Asana very impressive and cool. Especially, animation effects make workflow very interesting. 4) The quality of project management is high since Asana gives you a chance to track or monitor projects in a single place","Cons: 1) Email notifications can be sometimes annoying, since Asana send you notifications about every comment, task or subtask. Maybe, in next updates, Asana team can decrease the frequency of notification emails due to the importance level of taks. 2) There would be very useful if Asana adds tracking system for bugs. Sometimes during work procedures, workers need tracking system for bugs to solve those issues not to waste time and quality of work"
1613,1613 Asana,Asana,Seifeddine B.,iOS developer engineer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,3,5,,5,8,“My personal experience ”,Overall: Our teams work at different project at the same time and we need to know the progress of everyone with notifications to be able to run theses projects smoothly.,7/7/2020,"Pros: comparing to other free software, asana is value worth it, you can organise all your projects in one tab(teams also) and for that , it did speed up our flow significantly.","Cons: I found that founding a project in different team can be a little headache at first but once you learn how to use asana, you can manage and find everything with ease."
1614,1614 Asana,Asana,Sam E.,Marketing Operations,Retail,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“I'm Asana's Biggest Fan!”,Overall: We manage incoming briefs from 20+ stakeholders around the globe and then project manage them through our 10-person US based creative team. Asana makes this process seamless and allows for maximum visibility across all stakeholders.,23/6/2020,"Pros: Everything about Asana has been so easy. Implementation and set up, training, using new features and continuing to improve our methods (our system of portfolios, tags, projects, etc).","Cons: Very few things. We've had a few minor issues or feature requests. Turns out, most feature requests are on the roadmap and many have already been implemented! Anything else, we've had excellent support to help us troubleshoot and come up with an alternative solution."
1615,1615 Asana,Asana,Christina S.,Writer,Online Media,2+ years,4,4,4,,,5,“Great software for keeping large groups organized”,Overall:,13/6/2020,"Pros: Asana is completely online, which means loads of people can have up-to-the-minute updates 24 hours a day. Although the site can be a little show to load, the site is well-maintained and has few problems.","Cons: The software is in some ways over simple and could use extra features. Users seem to be able to edit things just as much as admins. Overall a great product for simple, single step jobs with time of people but not as good for small groups with complex projects."
1616,1616 Asana,Asana,John A.,Systems Administrator,Retail,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Asana is tops”,Overall: We use this many times a day to keep track of the many projects happening everyday.,19/5/2020,Pros: Very easy to create new projects and assign various parts to users. Keeping track of a project status is simple.,Cons: Their search function is notoriously bad. It fails to find things when entering the exact name sometimes much less a partial name.
1617,1617 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Writing and Editing,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“An author's friend”,Overall: The ease with with which i am able to write my thoughts and share them with my team when i need to. I am especially in love with the board feature. Each dropdown board becomes a chapter idea. That just works for me.,15/4/2020,Pros: The way it allows me to organize my thoughts as i develop my manuscripts causes me to go to it everyday. ON ANY DEVICE I MAY BE USING AT THE TIME,Cons: Nothing really. I am not a perfectionist so i think its perfect at least for what i do.
1618,1618 Asana,Asana,Fausto F.,Graphic Design,Design,2+ years,5,4,5,5,,10,“The Best way to manage your daily workflow”,Overall: It's a great app that had supported me for a very long time in my work.,21/3/2020,Pros: I like how it makes task managment easy to follow and the communication with every other user is pretty much clear.,"Cons: There are times when you want to see some details on finished task but they are gone, and when starting to use it you can get kind of lost."
1619,1619 Asana,Asana,Dominique W.,Director of Digital Media,Retail,2+ years,3,2,3,1,3,3,“Meh - If you want to spend the extra money I guess”,"Overall: Negative - features too expensive, ease of use very low considering things that would otherwise would seem a common topic you have to hunt down information on and support is usually no help.",20/3/2020,Pros: Start and end date feature is great (if you can afford it) - 3 stars Animations are cute - 5 stars Colour Coding - N/A - basic project management feature Task duplication - 4 stars View options - 3 stars,Cons: After discovering other more robust software it became apparent how much Asana was lacking and how over priced it was. Things like start and end date are basic functionalities that should be available at the free level if they're not willing to negotiate the price for extremely small teams. Some may think if your team is so small do you need this software and the answer is yes. In todays economy and on creative teams in general you often have tiny teams working on massive projects with many moving parts and you need software that will keep you on track without decimating your budget $40+/month for 2 people? IDTS. On top of that things like not being able to rearrange the order tasks appear and having theme appear in the calendar based on which tag was created first is extremely frustrating Support was usually subpar at best. This pricing and lack of flexibility is even more head scratching when you see how large the small business/side hustle industry is expanding and how few features Asana has per subscription level compared to competitors. In using Asana at previous jobs there is also a decided lack of strategy and communication when rolling out updates compared to competitors which was maddening at my last position.
1620,1620 Asana,Asana,Jonathan T.,Co-Founder,E-Learning,2+ years,4,4,4,,4,8,"“Early Adopter, Still Use and Like It”","Overall: I've used asana for years to keep track of tasks and execute them, both personally and as part of a team.",3/3/2020,"Pros: What I love about Asana is how they just keep adding features. Now, these days most of them are added to the premium tiers, but some of them find their way to the free tier. The interface is clean and easy to use. It's a powerhouse of a task management system.","Cons: It took them a while to be able to switch between views (had to choose between board and list at the very beginning of a project) but you can switch now. I've used Asana for a loooong time, so I'm used to when everything was free and I didn't get locked out of new features, but I understand they need to make money."
1621,1621 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Higher Education,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,“Great software to manage projects”,"Overall: Asana is a great software to stay organized and on top of projects with calendar, timelines, assignment features, and notifications. The program also syncs to many other applications to assist with project management (slack, dropbox, email, and more). The free version even offers a lot for your teams",19/2/2020,"Pros: Great to organize projects you are working on either by yourself or with a team that you can assign tasks to complete and build a timeline. My team that manages multiple different departments uses this software to manage individual marketing projects, while also contributing to our comprehensive team marketing calendar. It allows you to see at a broad team view of things happening and ""going out"", as well as individual projects going on and what stage they are in.","Cons: A little bit of a learning curve but can easily watch tutorials provided by Asana and quickly then utilize the software and all its capabilities. It takes a little bit to set up templates, but once you do, you can then use them for all your projects (if your projects are similar in process and same people involved with same task to complete per project). Once you get that complete, it does end up saving a ton of time in the long run and keeps your team highly organized."
1622,1622 Asana,Asana,Kim D.,Technician,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,5,3,3,7,"“Asana, a fantastic tool.”","Overall: Attending to issues timeously is a great thing for a company, it shows customer value.",6/2/2020,Pros: It's a great was yo stay on top of your daily tasks. It allows you always to prioritise your work in a professional manner.,"Cons: It's mainly just for office use. It cannot really be custom made for your specific team, So it's functions are standard throughout."
1623,1623 Asana,Asana,Matthew H.,EVP,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Revolutionary!”,Overall: Fantastic! I don't know how we functioned as a company in the years before we found Asana,6/2/2020,Pros: It is so easy to collaborate tasks and workflow between remote team members with asana. Organization is key,Cons: Sometimes I come across annoying oversights. Like not having an easy way to switch subtasks from one task to another (need to do it one at a time)
1624,1624 Asana,Asana,Lucas B.,Sales Department,Fishery,2+ years,5,4,5,5,4,9,“I can work without messengers now”,,19/12/2019,,"Cons: Only 15 administrators can work in the free version. This is enough for a small company, but for a large one - quite a bit. A paid version of Asana is quite expensive even for corporations."
1625,1625 Asana,Asana,Alethea A.,Senior Editor,Publishing,2+ years,4,4,3,4,,5,“Switched to another service”,"Overall: It was great when we first started using it, it was great. But as the needs of our team expanded so did our need for other functionalities that Asana did not have.",16/12/2019,Pros: At the time we used Asana to for article submissions and it was helpful to have it all in a place we could access.,Cons: It didn't have all the functionality our team needed to schedule and I didn't like the format as much as the product we switched to.
1626,1626 Asana,Asana,Natasha A.,Analista corporativo,Government Administration,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,9,“Streamlines and perfects the execution of your projects”,"Overall: It is an efficient and productive organization tool, you can take advantage of collaborative work with it, as it improves it, making it more useful in the tasks that we are most skilled",15/12/2019,"Pros: Cloud-based application that allows you to manage projects in an organized way, it is very useful for large work teams and that handle multiple tasks with deadlines, streamlines collaborative work and communication. It has a very aesthetic multiplatform interface, easy to use, and with very useful integrations","Cons: Technically we have not had any inconvenience, but if it is necessary to be attentive to the follow-up so that it is not difficult to manage several projects at once"
1627,1627 Asana,Asana,Nick P.,Senior Creative,Graphic Design,2+ years,5,3,5,,,8,“Asana is a robust project management tool that's easy to use”,Overall: It's a good solution for small-medium size teams to plan and keep track of your projects.,10/12/2019,"Pros: It helps us keep on track with all of our projects. We have Slack for day to day communications, but for planning and keeping track of large projects, we needed a dedicated tool. So far it's been great","Cons: There are a lot of features. Which is a good thing, but the UI/UX is a bit confusing. It took me a while to find the project names, which is kind of a big thing. I think that could be improved a lot."
1628,1628 Asana,Asana,John C.,Founder,Management Consulting,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“Great for individual and for Team use”,Overall:,5/12/2019,"Pros: This is great for team and individual use. You can use it for Project management, you can use it as a Todo list app, or a tool to help you accomplish your goals, and organize your family. I love that you can have a list format and Kanban options. Although, the Kanban option is not nearly as good as Trello","Cons: Their KanBan board has some great things like you can have the same card be used in multiple projects. However, my biggest complaint is that that once you star in a KanBan, you can't switch to a list format, or once you start with a list you can't convert to a Kan ban board."
1629,1629 Asana,Asana,Vlad P.,Digital Marketing Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Has all the tools needed to manage and organize team projects”,,3/12/2019,,Cons: Sometimes it sends too many reminder notifications but its easy to turn them off or configure the settings to suit your needs.

If you want to improve your team's efficiency at tracking and completing tasks and maintaining good internal communications, I would definitely recommend you check it out. I also think the pricing is very reasonable for what it offers.",27/11/2019,"Pros: It is probably the most well rounded Project management tool I have ever used. Tons of useful features including some that I didnt even know we needed. It makes it really easy to delegate tasks to team members and then keep track of them to ensure that they finish in a timely manner. You can share tasks within your team on the fly and its great at making sure that you follow them to conclusion. I also like that it integrates well with my Outlook, automates a small part of my daily workflow. Lastly, its pretty decent as a team communication tool as well.",Cons: Not much to dislike to be honest. I havent had any real issues with it. One thing I will say is that the interface can be a little daunting when you are new. There is too much stuff on the screen at once.
1631,1631 Asana,Asana,ANNA C.,Director of Operations,Entertainment,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,10,“Asana is a daily life saver”,Overall:,19/11/2019,Pros: Keeps me organized from daily to do lists to long term projects! It is so extensive with what it can do as well.,"Cons: I honestly love everything about this software, but there is a definite learning curb to it and take a new user a bit more time than other products"
1632,1632 Asana,Asana,Nicole P.,Account Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,3,4,10,“Asana for storing important things”,Overall: Great! It's my back pocket for things I need to remember to do each day.,19/11/2019,Pros: I can find anything I need because it's an easy organizational tool. I keep resources I refer to daily in my account for ease of use.,Cons: Hard to say because I use it at a very basic level. I don't see how the teams function works well but it's probably because I haven't tried.

I was able to build my own list and also assign to other people in my department. New capabilities in the last couple years have also been impressive,"Cons: I've worked for 2 businesses that have utilized Asana. They are always impressed with the features but fail to follow through with adding new tasks to the system. It seems to take too long or be too inconvenient for everyone to follow through and truly utilize asana as it should be. Maybe more integrations would help? I'm not sure if there is an integration with gmail yet, that would certainly help to keep these tasks in the forefront."
1634,1634 Asana,Asana,Ryan N.,COO,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,3,5,5,8,“Great UI/Feature Set”,Overall: Great product - we just ended up needing a more sophisticated tool to manage our projects.,31/10/2019,"Pros: I love the keyboard accessibility, the attractive and accessible interface, the price point. It's a great product for small ad agencies.","Cons: Time tracking is left to 3rd party integrations. Like many collaborative apps, Asana has no features relating to product budget."

It's like a virtual to do list.,17/10/2019,Pros: I love using Asana to assign different tasks to people within our organization. We can have departments and projects all in one place and set deadlines for ourselves and others.,"Cons: I do not like how you can't add to more than one project at a time. Stopping and pressing the + sign on the right, is time consuming. Please let us tab or comma- and add to more than one project."
1636,1636 Asana,Asana,Elizabeth D.,Executive Director,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“To Do List Must Have”,Overall: This product is amazing. It keeps everything streamlined and organized.,15/10/2019,"Pros: Free is an unbeatable price and in this case, you get a lot of product that helps keep you organized.

It helps us create and keep track of project plans and timing.,Cons: It took me a while to fully understand how to use the different features on Asana. I think a how to would be useful.

Most interns also say they really enjoy it because it is a way to assist with tasks and see what everyone is doing .,20/9/2019,Pros: I liked how you can see who is assigned each job. For example if an opps team is splitting up tasks you have the ability to see their que and even out the work load.,Cons: Is there a way to hide your que? I only learned basic functions when I started using asuna - Maybe a training would of helped or a quick click through tutorial that is always available for questions

We did manage it for our construction and event management. We look forward to come back to Asana in couple of months, as current management software which we are using is limiting us in many ways in which Asana was way too easy.",23/8/2019,"Pros: - Ideal for managing tasks - Ideal for managing small teams - You can manage a team at a remote location - Don't require many training hours, all tools and management is self explanatory.","Cons: - Free version limits you to add more members - need to improve integration with google cloud - Should integrate whats app / sms for tasks or reminder sending - There should be a calendar, which should popup when a person login, to show the deadlines and tasks pending - there should be multiple admins - Only English Language (there should be option for multiple languages like Urdu)"

That is a huge aspect of our business, and it used LITERALLY EVERY DAY",Cons: There is a steep learning curve that is really undersold.

I only have experience using the free software, not the paid for version. I enjoy using this tool and find it beneficial for companies, especially agencies who need to manage daily workflows and tasks. I would recommend this platform.",24/7/2019,Pros: I love the fact that the platform is extremely easy to use. The user experience and functionality is well thought out and the platform is visually appealing.,"Cons: I don't really have any cons, however, an integrated time-tracking tool would be useful."
1642,1642 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Automotive,2+ years,5,4,4,4,4,8,“Organize your projects”,"Overall: My experience so far with Asana is good. The only thing is if the whole team is not using it, you're not using it to its full potential. I see that happening within my organization.",23/7/2019,Pros: I really like how easy this project management system is to use.,Cons: I feel like I am not using it to its full potential. There are a lot of cool things I could be using but don't know-how.
1643,1643 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Financial Services,2+ years,3,4,2,4,3,6,“A Good Task Management system for small teams”,"Overall: My overall experience with Asana is satisfactory. If you're looking for a basic task management system without hassles, Asana is a good choice, but if you like more features and want to extend functionality using API and integrations, there are far better options than Asana.",23/7/2019,Pros: The thing I like the most about Asana is it's simplicity. Its easy to get grasp of the functionalities and easy to create and assign task to team members with appropriate deadlines.,"Cons: The thing I like the least about Asana is the feature set. The features are very basic for an organisational task management system. Also, integrations and api is not a strong point for Asana. The market is competitive and Asana is way behind in competition."

Great for reminders and assigning tasks,15/7/2019,"Pros: Asana is extremely user friendly, aesthetically pleasing and organized as a task organizer/to-do software.

1646,1646 Asana,Asana,Candace C.,Senior Technical Writer,Government Administration,2+ years,5,3,5,,5,10,“Great for Project Management”,"Overall: Despite the learning curve, Asana is great for managing and organizing tasks in a program. I've used it to complete many projects",12/7/2019,Pros: Great (free!) way to manage projects and programs.

Teams can use it differently with incohesive expectations. If teams set up their sections/boards differently, it can cause problems aligning on goals and projects down the road. Be sure to have a standard policy in place before beginning."

You truly can customize the way you plan projects, store data, and plan for the future with this product.","Cons: It took me a few weeks to truly get the feel for how to use Asana in its entirety.

The portfolios function took too much time to update, the proofing function was too difficult too coordinate amongst different reviewers and the forms function was hard to move around and was too wordy when submitted as one task."

It is easy to create a task, set a due date, assign it to your resource, give a brief description, and comment directly on the task so that everyone can clearly see everything. It will also send you reminders on due dates and also let you know if a task has been assigned to you. Sometimes marking a task complete triggers a little surprise image, very cute. It allows you to attach documents to all the different tasks but on the overall project level you can view all files associated.

It'll load quite a few pages worth, then will load the next group when you scroll down the the bottom of the loaded section.

And *then* it's possible to search through the entire list to pick out specific tasks/search-terms on the page."

It is helpful for making timelines and organizing projects, and it is also useful that multiple people can create, assign and check off tasks.","Cons: Sometimes I feel like the interface was hard to navigate and did not actually organize my thoughts and tasks very well. I almost preferred to just make a simple check list on pen and paper over using Asana because of all the filters and organizers I would need to set up, rather than just getting to work on the tasks."
1674,1674 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Hospitality,2+ years,5,3,4,1,2,7,“It Works”,"Overall: It's fine. It's just ANOTHER way for people to contact us internally when we are trying to consolidate communications.

It all works well within the organiztion,"Cons: Its very expesive if you want to go to the next level, pro. We rent going to spend that kind of money."

The system is intuitive and the functionality of the UI is well developed. Projects, tasks and workflow are great in the ""bucket"" view, our preferred task view. The calendar is also nice for big picture look at organization.","Cons: When entering a new task on the ""board"" view, clicking ""enter"" doesn't just solidify/save the task, it also creates an additional task. Very minor detail that requires an extra 2 mouse clicks. So, in other words, there is not much I dislike with this application."
1677,1677 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Design,2+ years,4,5,4,,4,9,“Get everyone involved ”,"Overall: Asana is visually stunning, it's incredibly easy to get an overview of a project, and easily modify its moving parts (AKA task cards). The learning curve is mild at best, meaning the users flow is mastered quickly and easily. The card structure, assigning team members to specific cards, attaching photos, comments and then moving those cards around on the giant project board makes it all ever so seamless.",4/12/2018,"Pros: The interactive structure of the board is sublime, drag and move, add photos, assign team members, add and edit comments, and get immediate notifications, fantastic UX.","Cons: Assigning task priorities could use some restructuring, in its current state it doesn't do much more than color code the tasks."

The way that the tasks are set up are nice as well because I can filter which ones I need to focus on",Cons: I wish there was a set way for everyone to use the service because individuals use it differently.

You have your different groups and assign different tasks to different groups and people in the group. I also like that they have a free version. This way you can try out the product before you purchase a license.,Cons: What I liked least about the software is there's very many options. It would be nice to be able to post recurring tasks and possible add more charts and graphs or reports to look at and being able to customize the reports more.

The ability to add multiple projects and invite team(s) into each project and seeing the calendar view makes planning out the day a breeze.",20/9/2018,"Pros: Asana 2.0 has come a long way versus the original 1.0. Although 1.0 was pretty good at keeping track of tasks, Asana 2.0 makes things a lot more fluid in updating the team on what project (or tasks) need the most attention. Notifications has gotten a lot better on Asana iOS, where e-mail notifications as a backup makes it ideal for those who work out of e-mail. The calendar view on Asana also is a nice touch, so you can see what your day looks like, this is a nice touch compared to just traditional task - list like most to-do apps.","Cons: Asana needs its own desktop app, still waiting for it."

With how organized you want to be, there's sub tasks to tasks and you can create agendas for tasks. Since I'm a Type A person, I really like to get to the nitty-gritty of organizing my tasks so it took a while for me to get adjusted and used to the style that Asana organizes itself."

The genius behind that is crazy good for our organization. With a designer getting immediate feedback from staff members in the workflow makes it even better,Cons: I don't like how someone else can archive an event and it goes away on my side of things as well. It forces me to dig around a bit more than I'd prefer.

When working inside projects and tasks you can get lost in the sea of sidebars and boxes available on the screen. Reducing this and allowing for less to focus on at a time could help.

It is at heart a task management program that also happens to replace email and streamline communication.","Cons: It lacks in features..Enterprise-level businesses should probably steer clear of this software, at least for now, but I do heartily encourage small and medium-sized operations to give Asana a try. What it lacks in features it makes up in sheer usability and a wealth of relevant integrations."

It's silly to me that you can only have 100 projects per team.

The ability to create custom fields is a real bonus to personalising the system,Cons: When you send a task to someone via email and your email happens to have a number of attachments/images then the person will receive multiple email alerts as the images slowly upload (if they have emails alerts on)

When you create subtask then it will remain hidden and is difficult to find. i did not use the tech. support for this much but i find it little difficult to find the help chat box when i started using this initially.
1707,1707 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,11-50 employees,2+ years,4,3,5,5,,,“Wonderful for SIMPLE project tracking”,,16/1/2018,,"Cons: For complex tasks that have lots of dependencies and steps, Asana may not be the best solution. I use it for high level tasking, but it has a difficult time handling steps that have 2 or 3 different sub-levels of tasks involved."
1708,1708 Asana,Asana,Aaron R.,Selbstständig,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,4,5,,,“Asana is a great tool for everyone who wants to be productive”,,17/11/2017,,"Cons: Unfortunatley, you cannot enter ""events"" in the calendar but only tasks. For me, adding this feature would make asana even better to use. Also, I experienced some issues inviting other people to projects, but after a while it worked."
1709,1709 Asana,Asana,Blake W.,Digital Marketing Manager,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Super easy way to keep yourself and your team organized and accountable”,Overall: I'm more organized and accountable to my team.,14/11/2017,Pros: It's a very easy way to keep your tasks and team on the same page. It's easy to build projects that have deadlines and assign them to specific people.,"Cons: Nothing at the moment. Every time there is a piece that I think could be improved, they improve it. There are constant updates and new features."
1710,1710 Asana,Asana,Ashley N. B.,Director of Public Policy,Public Policy,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,9,“A better option for project management”,"OverallPros: I would recommend Asana to others because it is easy to use and easy to implement, especially with members of the office who are less tech-savvy. The interface is very digestible -- the platform has everything where I need it. The support team is great, too.",7/11/2017,,"Cons: It would be great if there could be a feature that would allow users to edit comments or to use rich text editing within a task. Also, file hosting would be helpful."
1711,1711 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,,5,,,“Great Up Time!”,Overall: Asana has great up time and amazing developers. They have an area you can track downtime issues when they come up (though it is very infrequent). The features are amazing and Asana is constantly adding more. They're open to suggestions and there are plenty of integrations.,6/9/2017,"Pros: Usability, features and uptime.",Consider other task management systems and their features as well as the associated costs. You're unlikely to beat Asana.
1712,1712 Asana,Asana,Caleb G.,Sales & Marketing Manager,Publishing,2+ years,4,4,4,5,5,9,“Managing multiple projects is now easy. ”,"Overall: Easy to use. The search feature is probably my favorite as it saves time from searching e-mails. Asana also is a great way to archive projects and files (such as ads, for us), which saves having to print and store a physical copy.",11/7/2017,"Pros: For a small business that publishes multiple international magazines, it's a huge time saver. It cuts down on having to search hundreds of e-mails for a file or ad proof. It also saves having to print everything for archival purposes.","Cons: I only use the free version, so I'm not fully aware of every feature, but my only complaint would be there is currently no stand-alone app (for Mac). The web-based version can be a little laggy at times, but nothing too serious."
1713,1713 Asana,Asana,Eric L.,Business Operations,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,5,,,9,“Great app for personal todos or group project management”,Overall: Great app - hope Dustin can find a monetization method,7/6/2017,"Pros: Simple, intuitive UI, powerful features, great keyboard shortcuts. Great integration of personal todos with work or shared todos. I use both for personal projects and work projects.",Cons: Long loading time when first opening the app. No dedicated desktop app (but there is a work around you can find on google)
1714,1714 Asana,Asana,Tales B.,Head of Marketing & Sales,Health,2+ years,5,4,5,2,3,10,“Collaboration is everything”,"Overall: In addition to every amazing aspect of Asana as a project manager, I believe the most valuable thing they've done is to teach people how to collaborate and the benefits in terms of quality and speed. When I started to work at my current company, I was the only one using Asana to organize the activities of my team. Now, almost two years latter, the role company is using it - and loving it! We can make things faster, we can organize things better, we can have knowledge management easily and everyone can collaborate with everyone, even if they are not around, when they are able to.",14/2/2017,Pros: Amazing UX,Cons: Pricing
1715,1715 Asana,Asana,BRice W.,Director of Human Resources,Real Estate,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,10,“One of the best!”,Overall: Asana has helped me stay involved in all of the projects my team is working on without me having to ask for updates or seem overly micromanaging of a process.,20/11/2016,Pros: Easy to use. App mirrors desktop version. Always adding new features.,Cons: Could use a little more administrative control. I wish the new custom fields were a little more flexible. Would like them to be assigned to a single task or subtask rather than showing up on the entire project.
1716,1716 Asana,Asana,Cindy B.,"CEO, Project Manager",Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,3,3,4,9,“Great Product”,"Overall: We use Asana in our agency for managing multiple projects at any given time. The new features that the Asana team has implemented have made this an essential part of our project management. It's easy to use, a great value, and I feel like the tool is constantly improving.",18/11/2016,Pros: The team collaboration tools,Cons: There is no way to easily track velocity or do projections like there is in other tools.
1717,1717 Asana,Asana,Carolina M.,Head of Operations,Food & Beverages,2+ years,5,5,3,3,5,10,“Asana Good for Productivity”,"Overall: Since pushing our whole team to transition to Asana, it has been a life saver. Less emails, more clear communication, less things falling through the cracks. I wish they would also integrate meetings into Asana... we use boards for all our meetings but they are called projects and are treated as such. If they could add a meetings board where all history (ie. 'minutes') were saved in chronological order after being checked off, would be wonderful.",17/11/2016,"Pros: Ease of use, design.","Cons: Needs to enable more ways of using this software. Need to let people check off things, heart things, etc. FROM EMAIL and not always have to open Asana."
1718,1718 Asana,Asana,Catherine C.,Purchasing,Building Materials,2+ years,4,5,4,4,4,5,“Good Report Partner”,Overall: Asana will be good on share the task and report best partner. Although I still have many part to learn it but I feel it very good on sharing the task information to my colleague well. It can text and tag to my colleague when on the key point I wanna them read. When I read some good point reply from them I can give them a like. I can assign the task to the one I decide so that I know the task is under he/she care. Time to time I can follow up and check back what I had did on which I had post on. It's really good and I will continue to support on it. Thank You.,3/11/2016,Pros: Sharing Task and Report,Cons: Post my report to my colleague
1719,1719 Asana,Asana,Daniel A.,owner,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“A vital piece of our agency's project management process”,Overall: Asana has become a vital piece of our agency's project management process. It's helped make more visible a complex series of dependent tasks and helped our team members stay on deadline.,3/11/2016,Pros: I like that the interface is easy to learn and use. The project/section/task hierarchy is well designed.,Cons: I find the app to be less easy to navigate and less intuitive than the desktop version
1720,1720 Asana,Asana,Damiaan M.,Junior Designer,Design,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,9,“Asana makes managing large projects a breeze!”,"Overall: Asana is the backbone of the work we do here at the small axe, it keeps us on top of our workloads and lets us comfortably overview, task up and track an entire project with many moving parts with relative ease.",3/11/2016,Pros: the ui/ux and overall ease of use.,"Cons: I would like to see more options for categorising tasks relevant to specific projects in my feed, i want the option of relevant reflowable folder systems, so i can group the tasks in my feed not only relevant to the due date but also broken down per project etc"
1721,1721 Asana,Asana,Brian C.,Information Analyst,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,9,“Keep up the great work!”,"Overall: Asana has gone a long way for the company I work for; before we utilized Asana we had long email chains that would get convoluted and confusing. Now we can organize our tasks, assign them out and mark them complete when finished. My only small complaint is when you receive an email alert regarding a task from Asana, regardless of whether you assigned the task/commented on it/completed it, the subject line is 'Assigned to You' which can be frustrating.",3/11/2016,Pros: Great for organizing tasks.,Cons: Subject line of the email alerts is ALWAYS 'Assigned to you' even if the action done on Asana was completing the task.
1722,1722 Asana,Asana,Bryan J.,Ecommerce Operations Specialist,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,10,“Stay Organized with Asana”,"Overall: I have been using Asana for three years. I have used it as a project manager and on the production side. Asana keeps me and my team organized, not only as a task list but as a central repository of project assets. Asana is the most valuable tool in our project management arsenal.",3/11/2016,Pros: Centralization of project assets and team communication.,Cons: The available themes.
1723,1723 Asana,Asana,Callie Rae M.,Head of Family Experience,Education Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,10,“A great option for teams”,Overall: I work with a team of about 60 people who are spread across the country. Asana has really helped us to keep in touch and collaborate about our projects and work. I love that I can easily see what others are working on so that I can jump in with suggestions or plan my own work accordingly.,3/11/2016,Pros: Easy to use and quite functional.,Cons: Most of the cons have to do with my own knowledge of the program. We've been using it for a year plus and I'm still finding out how some things work. But so far I haven't found much I don't like.
1724,1724 Asana,Asana,Stanley C.,CEO,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“A task management system that we are looking for”,Overall: We have gone through a few tasks management systems and they are just not sticky enough for our digital agency. Some are too sophisticated and the rest of task management systems do not work well with task sharing with other users. Finally came across Asana and love the part that I get notified on update to tasks that I have assigned out or following up on.,21/7/2016,"Pros: Simple to use, offline sync on Android app, notification on tasks I assigned out or following up on.",
1725,1725 Asana,Asana,Justin T.,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,3,3.5,3,,,6,“Asana - A great tool with some limitations”,,6/7/2015,,"Cons: Although the product is designed to reduce the amount of emails, the default settings actually increased the amount of emails in my inbox. I was constantly receiving daily updates and reminders on what needed to be done still. Every time someone commented on the Asana task, I would receive an email. I know that this could be changed in the settings, but I believe this should have just been the default."
1726,1726 Asana,Asana,Bryce M.,,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4.5,4,,,10,“Asana Makes Our Marketing Operations Run Smooth”,,1/7/2015,,Cons: I have having to try and convince people to use this instead of emailing tasks. Everyone thinks its just another fad product or solution. I wish it were easier to transition people to Asana (maybe a tool that grabs emails?) Not sure what Asana can do about that. I also wish that I could allow an email fire rule that emailed someone outside of Asana when a task as complete (like linked to my outlook or gmail). Better email integration would be nice.
1727,1727 Asana,Asana,mandy L.,Chief Strategy & Marketing Officer,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Amazing software & support!”,Overall: It's amazing! It's a tool that holds us all accountable and provides a common language & view of how we're doing on our work.,29/10/2020,"Pros: The ease of use and intuitive nature of the software. It flows well. I love the cute features like maximum celebration and ""TabB"". It's very clever and you can tell real humans designed it. It works only as well as the user, though, so you have to ensure you set it up properly","Cons: I get lost when I search for a project / portfolio. Sometimes I have to ""click down"" many clicks to find what I need. I know it's garbage in / garbage out; a lot of it is related to board / project / portfolio setup"
1728,1728 Asana,Asana,Erez L.,2nd Tier Tech Support,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Asana helps departments coordinate and follow up on company-wide tasks”,,23/10/2020,,"Cons: Nothing at all, it's a web based service that helped the company's departments communicate better and see what each team is handling at the moment."
1729,1729 Asana,Asana,Lacie L.,Owner,Executive Office,2+ years,4,4,4,,,10,“Excellent for teams to work on projects”,Overall: This has improved on task management between my office and clients.,13/10/2020,"Pros: When I create a task I can assign collaborators. This emails team members notifications when updates are made, keeping everyone in the loop and allowing people to talk within a specific project/task.","Cons: When I miss a task with a repeating due date, in order to bring it current it appears I have to mark it complete for every day that was missed. This can be tedious when coming back from a vacation."
1730,1730 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Law Practice,2+ years,5,5,5,4,,9,“Really like this”,Overall: I think it's made me more efficient and on top of the things that need to get done.,31/8/2020,"Pros: I find this incredibly easy to use and helpful to plan future projects and tasks for each. It has a nice structure, which helps.","Cons: I think there was a slight learning curve at first to maximize efficiency but once you are used to it, it's pretty fun to use."
1731,1731 Asana,Asana,Tamanna T.,Graduate Assistant,Higher Education,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,8,“Great for Teamwork”,Overall: It is an inseparable part of our team at work. We have varying schedule at work. Therefore I can assign tasks to teammembers whose shift does not overlap with mine.,10/8/2020,"Pros: It lets you coordinate with your team on a daily basis. I can delegate assignments and projects to my team. Follow up with them and track their development. If they have queries, they can reach out to me through teams.","Cons: I can not delegate one task to two team members. If has to be assigned to one person basis. When I delegate projects, and a team member clicks on ""complete"" after they are done with the project, all the details of the project will be lost."
1732,1732 Asana,Asana,Ryan K.,Facilities Maintenance Specialist,Philanthropy,2+ years,4,3,3,,,5,“ASANA if you wanna collaborate but not in house.”,"Overall: Will probably keep this software around for certain specific types of projects that need some of its better features and there is very few opportunities for massive change throughout the planned duration of that particular project. In terms of a physical and tangible project I wouldn't bother, but if you have a team with lets say not the best social skills Asana could potentially save you a lot of grief dealing with interpersonal team issues.",6/8/2020,Pros: This software has the best intentions of keeping a team on task to accomplish projects with defined due dates. The idea of digital collaboration on a scale of real time implementation is something that I have thought very useful during a work day. We all work at different paces and not everyone is capable of maintaining each others pace or cadence. By using ASANA you can work on your assigned tasks while keeping tabs on your compatriots to ensure you are all maintaining a focused idea in whatever it is you are trying to accomplish.,Cons: Where this misses the mark is in physical implementation. You can caneasily set goal and timelines up but very little in the way of accountability or congruency if a team member falls behind. Trying to redistribute work loads proved clunky and troublesome. some of the features just appear too simplistic as well which can lead you to believe that the more complex ones wont do what it is you want them to do.
1733,1733 Asana,Asana,Melissa N.,Digital Marketing Executive,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Great tool for project management”,"Overall: Very happy with the software, I'd definitely recommend it.",20/7/2020,Pros: Very easy-to-use and intuitive. I use the software everyday for my daily tasks and it makes managing everything a lot easier.,"Cons: If I had to give one negative feedback, I'd say that I get a lot of email notifications, maybe too many."
1734,1734 Asana,Asana,Lorraine P.,Operations manager,E-Learning,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“A must for working from home ”,Overall: This is a must for our team since we all work remotely. Keeps us organized and accountable,16/7/2020,"Pros: Very intuitive, functional, offers all the features we could possibly need. Super organized and easy to streamline projects/tasks","Cons: When auto emails of updates are sent, they are oftentimes incomplete and in the middle of an update."
1735,1735 Asana,Asana,Ana C.,"Manager, Marketing & Special Projects",Health,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Your personal assistant”,Overall: It makes my personal and professional life easier.,16/7/2020,"Pros: Dependencies, Workflow, Portfolios, Custom Fields, Approval","Cons: I wish there could be an administrator even in the paid license, so the members of the company can be maintained and updated (remove projects and members that are no longer active or employed by the company)"
1736,1736 Asana,Asana,Stephen L.,Scrum Master,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,4,,,8,“Good for visibility of roadmaps”,Overall: Its good for the higher level parts of projects,26/6/2020,Pros: The timeline feature is simple to set-up and very intuitive. Its very easy to visualise large scale projects over time,"Cons: The security or permissions setting isn't as clear as it could be. We set up a load of projects only to find out that they were open, also if you add someone on a task they automatically get access to the whole prject. Sometimes that isn't desired behaviour"
1737,1737 Asana,Asana,Darby H.,Graphic Designer,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,4,4,4,5,10,“Love The Organization”,Overall:,25/6/2020,Pros: I love the project and subtask organization. The timeline feature is excellent. I use the reoccurring tasks feature daily and live the ease of communication with colleagues on projects.,Cons: I wish subtasks had all the same features as projects. I also didn't really like the automatic linking that duplicates the subtasks it makes things very messy.
1738,1738 Asana,Asana,Saba A.,Web developer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,4,3,4,9,“The easiest platform for project management”,Overall: I like how asana works and I use it every day. It makes everything easy when Im working on projects with my team.,17/4/2020,Pros: Asana is one of the most beautifull and easy project management platforms in the world. You can easily exchange tasks and some kind of project details with your team. It makes so much easier to stay focused on tasks.,Cons: The price is little bit high even for smaller teams too compared to other platforms like Asana. Also email notifications are little bit annoying.
1739,1739 Asana,Asana,Justin E. K.,Director of Opportunity Development,Renewables & Environment,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,10,“Daily business”,"Overall: We use Asana for our daily business operations, have a custom built CRM, and project management",26/3/2020,"Pros: Flexibility to manage large volume of tasks, sort them, share them, track repeating events, collaborate on projects/ tasks/ teams, build custom projects",Cons: Limited export capability for free version to report outside of lists

1741,1741 Asana,Asana,Frankie N.,Art Director,Design,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,7,“Task Management made easy”,Overall: I love it! It keeps us on the same page and allows us to triage our projects. Saving us time and double work in the end.,27/2/2020,"Pros: I really enjoyed the ease of use, and the fact that I could track the project and be on the same page as my team members.","Cons: There is an adjustment period, that deals more with getting ""buy-in"" from group members. You start to figure out what is necessary to put into Asana and whats not. The goal is to get the project done, not to spend all day making Asana perfect."
1742,1742 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Publishing,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“You get so much in the FREE version of ASANA”,"Overall: I've used spreadsheets, Jira and Trello to manage projects and I think the free version of ASANA beats them.",27/2/2020,"Pros: I love the organization of the application. To me, the app is very intuitive and it caters to all types of projects. It allows you to get in the weeds or an aerial snapshot of your projects.","Cons: Some folks find it difficult to pick up the tool and use it. It could use a better onboarding process. However, I thought it was really straight forward. I see that subtasks tend to confuse people."
1743,1743 Asana,Asana,Anthony K.,Editor,Publishing,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“Very helpful”,Overall: Perfectly functional and great for teams. Will use on future jobs.,25/2/2020,Pros: Can manage different teams and freelancers easily. Particularly useful for telecommuters. Extremely easy to learn.,Cons: It's too bad it doesn't integrate into Microsoft Outlook calendar but email reminders solve that so it's not a big deal.
1744,1744 Asana,Asana,Jean N.,Business development,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Asana is a great task keeping tool”,Overall: Great experience. Easy to use the app is very helpful for everyday task tracking,20/2/2020,Pros: I like it for project management and even use it in my everyday life to keep track of tasks. It is very helpful,Cons: Wish it Integrated with Salesforce that would be a game changer for sure when it comes to project management tools
1745,1745 Asana,Asana,Jared D.,Customer Success Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,3,,4,7,“Decent Project Management App”,"Overall: I use Trello, Monday.com and Todist for tasks and projects and all 3 tools are much more user-friendly, the UI is more comforting and intuitive and the customization of themes is more robust.",11/1/2020,Pros: Asana is a great tool for managing all of your tasks and projects in one place. They have a plethora of integrations and work well on mobile. They have a fair amount of customization and are very feature heavy.,Cons: The overall app feels a bit stale in terms of design. I also found the workflows for setting up and checking off to-dos to feel a bit strange compared to other tools I've used. I've had several coworkers also mention that they've moved to other tools over Asana because it just doesn't come across as very user-friendly.
1746,1746 Asana,Asana,Surekha B.,Operations Manager,Sporting Goods,2+ years,5,4,4,,,6,“Needs Some Work”,"Overall: Improves communication, efficiency, and clarity. I do enjoy using it, but would enjoy it more if it was more ""individual-friendly"".",16/12/2019,"Pros: It's faster than e-mail, updates in real time, and a cloud-based checklist (that you can log into from any device) is an excellent idea! I like that you can now set ""time due"" for a task instead of just a due date.","Cons: I wish I could build my own projects outside of the team. As such, I create my own projects in a separate application."
1747,1747 Asana,Asana,Betsy G.,Email & Digital Marketing,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,2,2,5,5,4,“Corporate Employee New to Asana”,Overall: My overall experience with Asana is just difficult. I tried watching videos to help understand and still did not understand.,16/12/2019,Pros: What I like most about this software is that I can add tasks within a project. This makes things easier for others to see what they need to do.,Cons: I am not a huge fan of this software at all. I felt like Basecamp was super easy to read and understand right away. Asana was super confusing and I still get lost looking for certain cards for projects.
1748,1748 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,8,“Great free project management platform”,Overall: My legal operations person used Asana at facebook and proposed using it for our legal team. It was good but a little clunky (i think this was before the days of the team workflows release). additionally we had to use the free version so the paid version may have been easier to use and less clunky.,10/12/2019,"Pros: A colleague of mine evangelized for Asana, and soon my entire team was using it. I found it very granular and time consuming, but it did a great job of getting everyone on the same page and organizing workflows and identifying who had action items.","Cons: Just a phase shift in terms of personal workflow. I had never used a tool like this before, so too much structure so fast really took some getting used to."
1749,1749 Asana,Asana,Ryan R.,Operations,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana is nothing short of a life saver!”,Overall: I am solving the organization of my organization. I have project after project and it is darn near impossible to track it all unless you have something like this.,3/12/2019,"Pros: Asana may be my favorite software I use because it keeps me super organized for a lot of projects I work on. As a leader, it is easy to assign pieces to my team and see what is getting done when. It saves me a lot of time checking in to see what is happening.","Cons: It took a bit of a learning curve to figure out all of the features and how to implement them. Even after months of using this, I still feel like I am missing things that will help me because I haven't learned about it yet!"
1750,1750 Asana,Asana,Pasquale G.,Software engineer,Education Management,2+ years,5,4,5,,,8,“Get things done”,Overall: We use Asana every day to keep track of task and activities. It helps our teams to focus on the real things to do.,3/12/2019,"Pros: Asana is an incredibly flexible application. The software does not impose a strict view or a predefined approach. Users can organize their projects according to their current needs without too much complexity or having a lot of forms to fill in. With growing complexity of the projects, the tool can grow as well and provide features as needed.",Cons: The flexibility can easily became anarchy. It is important to keep your projects tidy and clean. Without some form of control it easy to create an inextricable mess.
1751,1751 Asana,Asana,Ruben G.,Maintenance Engineer,Hospitality,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Extremely useful ”,Overall: As a maintenance Engineer this software is excellent for keeping track of all my work orders without all the paperwork,17/11/2019,"Pros: I recieve notifications to my phone when work orders are put in. You can add pictures. You can search for older stuff that was put in, so its great for keeping records of issues. I can even assign tasks for myself so i wont forget anything",Cons: I can honestly say that there is not a single bad thing about this software that i personally can think of

It's intuitive and had great functions so you can see if any activity or assigned party overlaps.,Cons: I'm not sure yet what I didn't like about it.

Asana allowed us to move away from a patchwork solution, to a full-featured solution that our clients love.",12/9/2019,"Pros: Project Management in this software is very, very intuitive. A few of the other project management software were too convoluted or things that should be simple were difficult.

I've found that as I train some of my Clients on it that it isn't as intuitive for them. Maybe they like the more aesthetic look of Trello or board style than Asana (although it can do that too).,"Cons: There are some really great features that's aid love to implement myself, but as a single-member business owner their pricing structure isn't what I need it to be yet."

For me it is a necessary tool for us.,17/5/2019,"Pros: According to my experience, I would say Asana has more helpful features than other applications keeps for project management. It keeps projects track by its advance functions and gather team on one place. Its mobile application presents more convenient environment for doing work in efficient ways.","Cons: This application is satisfying.

You can't see a gantt chart of all your projects in one place. To track time in a project, you need to pay for an other app that works with asana. You can't have two assignees for a task and every task has only two status possible : not done and complete. For a marketing agency, this is not enough. The subtasking isn't really nice to use. In fact, I hated it. It makes projects hard to understand and some tasks can be lost if the main task is complete and not the subtasks. It is confusing."

Notification show up as a little yellow dot- no sound or anything. Also I have to refresh to see my notifications. This does make it easy to get behind on a notification, as on gmail, I would see in real time. Also I have had a few problems with Asana resizes some files I sent through? Not sure if this was a one time bug, but that is definitely a problem."

This has done wonders for my shopping list, grocery, business, personal or otherwise. It helped me tremendously manage the redecoration of my bedroom and office. I would list all the items I need to buy, under the room it was associated with and put a tag for each store I could buy the item. Whenever I was at a store I would filter the by that store's tag and I haven't forgotten to get something from the store since.

I'm a former post-it note junkie and Asana has really helped break the addition.,26/3/2019,Pros: The UI of this program is stunning. Several interactive features trigger as you go about your daily tasks. The use of color makes me happy to mark off a task,"Cons: I have a hard time getting things to assign where I want them to sometimes. If you hit enter while typing a task title, it adds a blank task.

I love the custom fields feature allowing to add custom tags to tasks (like estimated hours) - Works on all platforms - The UI/UX is well thought out and intuitive - Lots of integrations,"Cons: - Tries to be a one size fits all tool. Yes, I know that Asana can technically be used for incident tracking, that doesn't mean that it works well as such. I think they should double down on integrations and making their core product better than trying to work in all these edge cases."

1803,1803 Asana,Asana,Shilpa H.,Project Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,5,,,8,“A great collaborative and tracking tool”,,4/11/2018,,"Cons:  - No way to prioritize the tasks - There's no chat or messaging options to users who are online, it has to always go through updating the tasks. - Can't find a way to assign more than one person to same tasks if responsibilities are shared - No workarounds to see all tasks in one place across different workspaces - Advanced features need some training"
1804,1804 Asana,Asana,Wendy M.,Relationship Coach & Meditation Teacher,Alternative Medicine,2+ years,4,5,5,,4,9,“Asana is good for project management”,"Overall: I like Asana a lot. It offers a variety of options, and allows someone new to project management to get their feet wet without needing to learn a lot first. They can basically learn as they go. But if you want something that allows a combo of beauty, function, and serious flexibility, Asana might not be what you really want.",2/11/2018,"Pros: Asana allows you to manage projects by breaking them down into tasks, assigning them to others, and marking them complete, among other things. It has a lot of options for how you manage your projects, including seeing things on a board, a timeline or a calendar. There are many choices for ensuring that things stay on track, with due dates and more. It allows you to add backgrounds images to your boards, as well.","Cons: While Asana was very intuitive and easy to learn how to use, it doesn't feel as robust as other project management software. Without paying for an upgraded account, it doesn't offer as much flexibility, and even if you do pay for an upgraded account, it feels like it just doesn't offer as much."

I think this is great for a smaller company or organization that is just getting started. For mid to large size you might want a more central system to keep track of tasks.,4/5/2018,Pros: It's visually nice to look at and very strait forward. Everything is relatively east to learn if you have never used any CRM or mrp system before. This task management software let's you group certain tasks and crjste sub tasks as well.,Cons: Sometimes its too simple and doesn't have the more advanced settings and configurations as other similar software.

You can organize by team, then category, then task and subtask, but at times I'd appreciate even more levels or intricacy within a task to divide up the work into more multiples of steps.

I know there was new functionality added to assigned priorities, etc, but I always have to keep a separate notebook also to keep my tasks straight - a daily, weekly, monthly view would be good to straighten out priorities."

My company has grown extremely quickly in the past 12 months, and we would not have been able to create as much content or manage as many incoming shipments had we not used Asana.",3/11/2016,Pros: We can simultaneously manage many different types projects and deadlines with ease.,Cons: The recurring task function doesn't work very well for us.
1858,1858 Asana,Asana,David L.,Head of Marketing,Transportation/Trucking/Railroad,2+ years,5,4,5,5,4,9,“Asana is a great application for task and team management”,"Overall: We've been using Asana for over a year now at Sharethebus. Our tech, product, marketing teams use it fully from sprint management to road mapping to gathering ideas from the entire company. It's proven incredibly useful for managing time, allocating resources, and remaining transparent as an organization. We've tried many different apps in the past, some were more feature rich for certain use cases (for instance, there are great tech team only task management apps out there), we prefer this as it works for us as a company.",3/11/2016,"Pros: Customizable, easy to use, robust.",Cons: The search function could be improved.
1859,1859 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Financial Services,2+ years,5,5,,5,,,“Great for Organizing”,"Overall: I was first introduced to Asana when I did some freelance work for a small company in AZ (I live in TX) and we used it to keep all of our team tasks up-to-date and organized. I enjoyed the app so much, I started using it for my full time job and even shared it with some of my managers and co-workers.",27/1/2016,"Pros: Great way to connect a team that was not physically located near each other (we operated across different states); even without a team to share it with, it's a great way to stay organized with any type of project","Cons: I personally don't care for the ""stories"" that are added to the comments section of tasks every time something happens (i.e. - task was created, task was updated, task was moved to another project, etc.). To me, all this extra stuff just clutters up the viewing pane. However, I know my freelance manager liked to be able to review what was happening since there was usually multiple people working on a task or project."
1860,1860 Asana,Asana,Robin P.,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4.5,5,5,,9,“Asana works well for startups”,,1/7/2015,,"Cons: Asana has been great in responding to questions and concerns about the product. There were a few fixes that were needed to our company's account and when we reported them to Asana, they were quick to repair the issues and kept us updated on the progress of the repairs."
1861,1861 Asana,Asana,Rachel G.,Project Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,4.5,,,10,“Evolved how I approach work ”,,22/6/2015,,"Cons: It's not flexible enough to work company-wide. Certain teams like client services and marketing have fully adopted Asana, while Product/Dev and the call center groups use their own different tools for productivity and task management."
1862,1862 Asana,Asana,Ariel L.,Consultant,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,3,5,,,8,“Exhaustive Task Management and Collaboration Tool”,"Overall: It might just be me, but this behavior to drive revenues might be because of their recent direct listing to make them look good on paper. More paying customers and revenues is always a good sign. But for the smaller teams (like where i'm part of) it sucks that you're forced to pay to see new developments.",27/10/2020,Pros: I've used Asana since 2012 and I've seen it developed from a simple collaboration tool to a very robust one. What i liked is the idea of lists within lists within lists -- which is essentially how any project looks like. So the ability to capture tasks and be able to collaborate with others in a simple UI is very helpful.,"Cons: The one thing i don't like about the current version is that almost all new features are behind the paywall. Everything it was lacking before is there, but you have to pay for it to access them. While i understand that they have to make money, it doesn't do well for customers. It might be better to just limit full funcitonality to 3 projects or something instead of the entire feature set."
1863,1863 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Architecture & Planning,2+ years,5,5,3,2,5,7,“Great low cost entry system”,"Overall: I use it more now for personal projects than for business. Using it with a team, without the overall calendar meant too many things slipped through the cracks",9/10/2020,Pros: There is a lot of functionality on the free plan. Small teams can utilize all the basic features with no need to upgrade to a free plan. Super easy to implement for a novice (client) and easy to navigate and understand,"Cons: The lack of an ""all projects"" calendar is a deal breaker for me as an administrator. Each project has its own calendar, but there is no ability to see milestones and calendar items as a whole for all projects in the organization."
1864,1864 Asana,Asana,Lindsay M.,Marketing Specialist,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Such a Helpful Tool ”,Overall: I have really enjoyed the organizational benefits of Asana. The way the software is set up can help you streamline your entire day if you let it,29/9/2020,"Pros: What I love about Asana is that it allows our team to collaborate on projects. Tasks can be assigned to other members, so there is never a question of who is handling what. It also has great app integration features (slack, etc.).","Cons: Nothing really. We came from using a few different softwares before to complete objectives that Asana handles alone now, so i'm very satisfied."
1865,1865 Asana,Asana,Monica K.,co-founder,Food & Beverages,2+ years,4,3,4,,,6,“Good Project management software”,"Overall: My overall experience has been a good one. As I mentioned, once I got the hang of it, I really loved working with it.",22/9/2020,"Pros: Asana allows us to track the progress of any given project in a very detailed way while collaborating not just with internal team members, but also with outside vendors.","Cons: Asana is slightly complicated to figure out. It took me a while to figure out all the bells and whistles that the software has, but once I figured them out, it made for a robust platform"
1866,1866 Asana,Asana,Jared F.,Operations,Food & Beverages,2+ years,4,4,5,4,3,6,"“Robust Product, But Pricey”",Overall:,21/9/2020,"Pros: It has everything anyone could want for a project management tool. Scheduling, task management, project oversight.","Cons: It is very robust, but very pricey. The year subscription does save a tad, but overall it would be improved if it could be charged by user. Or more customizable by needs of client."
1867,1867 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Civil Engineering,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Asana - task powerhouse!”,,11/9/2020,,"Cons: The user interface was a little bit confusing, but after a few uses it became second nature and was not a huge issue."
1868,1868 Asana,Asana,Ignacio C.,Corporate Account Executive,Computer Software,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,"“Stay on top of your work, never miss a beat”","Overall: I would not describe myself as an organized person but Asana makes it look like I have my stuff together, and know where I am, and where I am going.",28/7/2020,Pros: As some one who needs to juggle responsibilities of account management and hunting while also helping my team out. I need to make sure my task and projects I am working on are prioritized and still get enough visitbility so that nothing falls through the cracks. I am able to do this with Asana from anywhere.,"Cons: Sometimes it can be hard for my team to review what it is that needs to be done, but I think it is becuase of the way I have it set up. User error."
1869,1869 Asana,Asana,Ben M.,Senior Account Manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,4,4,10,“Great for Project and Client Management”,Overall: I use Asana to plan out work for clients and manage internal tasks for myself and my team.,27/7/2020,Pros: My favourite feature is the ability to plan out scopes of work for clients and give a clear vision of the work to come with the ability to communicate on aspects at our wish.,Cons: My least favourite feature is the internal My Tasks. I find most of the organization done is by myself and the software doesn't allow for categorization that would enhance my workflow.
1870,1870 Asana,Asana,Ami M.,Executive Assistant,Consumer Services,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,7,“ASANA helped my team get organized”,Overall: Its been great for my grounds teams. It helps the crews stay organized and in touch. Managing over 150 acres with multiple older building requires alot of coordination. Asana helps us stay on track.,26/7/2020,Pros: I like being to communicate and track tasks with different project teams and get updates in real time regardless of ability to meet in person to progress reports.,"Cons: Our older generation staff members found it cumbersome and time consuming to be required to update tasks frequently, but this reallly isnt a flaw in the software. I believe it more a generational issue. I believe we will overcome this issue as long as the software remains user friendly and easy to update."
1871,1871 Asana,Asana,Jalynn S.,Quality Analyst,Computer Software,2+ years,5,3,5,5,,10,"“Student, Quality Analyst, and Studying for certifications”",,19/6/2020,,Cons: I don't like not being able to set a default view for the main team page that holds all of the projects I have going. That's about it.
1872,1872 Asana,Asana,Anne A.,Practice Manager,Veterinary,2+ years,4,5,3,,4,7,“Asana - Great start!”,Overall: keeping track of projects short and long term keeping management meeting agenda items and f/u from those,19/6/2020,"Pros: Quickly add 'tasks', and assign them to others add notes and photos to the tasks mark completed when done","Cons: Follow up on the tasks, or ways to work with tasks that are multi-step ways to note 'waiting for....' vs action item i need to do better ways to note progress of task"
1873,1873 Asana,Asana,Eric R.,Content Writer,Writing and Editing,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Asana keeps us organized”,"Overall: For content development, product development, and other projects where multiple team members have to work on different aspects, Asana is a great way to keep every project organized and on schedule.",15/6/2020,"Pros: Asana is an excellent way to keep project workflows organized within a team with many moving parts. Setting up tasks is easy, and users just have to update the status when their part of the task is done and assign the next phase to the relevant team member.","Cons: Sometimes I find the Inbox in Asana mildly confusing. I can always find the most recent messages, but older messages seem to get buried easily."
1874,1874 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Events Services,2+ years,5,5,5,4,5,9,“Asana makes for marketing bliss”,Overall: My team's experience with Asana has been a good one. I would definitely recommend it to any else in the inbound marketing world.,19/5/2020,Pros: Asana makes it easy to plan for the marketing content we plan to release within the near future. It's easy to login as a team and each can work individually to upload content.,Cons: There is nothing I would change about Asana. The interface is user-friendly as is and there are plenty of features to choose from.
1875,1875 Asana,Asana,Olena K.,Director,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,5,5,3,4,9,“Great PM tool”,Overall: Excellent experience with the product and it's features,16/5/2020,Pros: It helps to have a 360-view of your tasks\priorities. It's a a great tool to stay on track and deliver on time,Cons: When i have a Long list of tasks and scroll down It's not easy to navigate. Vertical navigation doesn't work for me
1876,1876 Asana,Asana,Datis M.,Director of Marketing,Events Services,2+ years,5,3,5,,,9,"“There's a lot to learn, but it's a fantastic tool with a great interface”","Overall: All in all, it is a great tool. I think I'd gain a lot more from it if I dedicated 30-60 mins to training on all its functionality.",28/4/2020,"Pros: It's got a phenomenal visual interface, doesn't require a whole lot of work to manage and the visual graphics that pop up when you complete a task help amplify the ""reward"" of completing a task.","Cons: There is a bit of a learning curve to it. My contract developers use it and I follow their system for adding/giving feedback on tasks. It was slightly confusing to start - but again, I want to reiterate that I'm following my contractors' internal processes so there may be a better way of doing it. I also wish that when adding tasks from the list view and switching through columns using the ""tab"" key that you could start typing and the next column would start populating. Currently, you have to click onto the next column then start typing. Minor thing, but it could save a lot of time ... especially when assigning multiple tabs."

Has a lot of integrations.","Cons: It has maybe way too many functionalities at once, and not so many explanations about how to use them best. I would love to have some built in templates and a few videos with a-b-c's of how to use them best."
1878,1878 Asana,Asana,alexandra s.,senior quantitative researcher,Management Consulting,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,9,“Excellent Project Management Tools”,Overall: This is a great tool for coordianting tasks for complex projects across teams. Everyone has visibility into the schedule and individual tasks and responsibilities. I can also overlay schedules to manage individual workloads across individuals on the team.,21/3/2020,"Pros: I can assign tasks to individuals with specified start and stop dates. Additionally, I can make tasks contingent on of other tasks. If the schedule changes, I can shift all downstream tasks without redoing the entire schedule.",Cons: It would be great if it integrated with the Microsoft office outlook calendar. You have to open the website to look at the schedule
1879,1879 Asana,Asana,Nikole L.,International Director,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Positive!”,Overall: This product is well designed with all the features I need to support my team across the globe.,17/3/2020,Pros: Our team loves the workflow on Asana.

The suite of tools that Asana offers allows everyone in our company to stay on track and deliver on their tasks and goals in a timely manner.,Cons: Asana offers so much that it actually can take a lot of time to truly use everything that it offers.

1883,1883 Asana,Asana,Mike P.,Senior Specialist - Web Marketing,Consumer Electronics,2+ years,5,4,5,,,9,“Great way to keep track of projects.”,"Overall: We manage multiple projects, cross departmentally, within the organization.

It's gives the ability to keep tabs on projects without constantly scheduling meetings.,"Cons: There's no real way of taking notes within the interface. If there was a sort of ""Notes"" section that is similar to Evernote or Microsoft Notes, it would be a one stop shop for project management."

It helps me to organize my week and to have a clear view of the tasks and where is the priority.",Cons: I didn't find anything that I don't like. Maybe it's that if I have a recurring task with subtasks but those subtasks are not recurring as well the platform makes it recurring tasks somehow by default.
1885,1885 Asana,Asana,Sadie R.,"Assistant Director, MIS Career Management",Higher Education,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Asana Review”,"Overall: I started using the desktop version of Asana for work in order to keep track of large scale projects that had many moving pieces. It really helped me to set little milestones and to stay on track of those milestones. It was also great for collaborating with others on these tasks and once I completed them, my team or boss would be notified. It is a great project management and collaboration tool.",7/1/2020,"Pros: I love using Asana because it is so intuitive and collaboration friendly! It keeps me on track with my tasks versus writing them down, etc. My boss can send me messages and tasks through the system which is really helpful","Cons: There is nothing I do not like about the software. There are other similar software systems, but I prefer Asana."

Something needs to be added necessarily, as it is impossible to communicate via e-mail quickly."

Great for starting out with project management, I've looked at other solutions and this was the easiest and least expensive way to get started with project management.",5/12/2019,"Pros: Real simple and easy to understand, it was quick to get up and running and create tasks for my monthly projects as well as one time projects. It notifies my team via email and the app which makes them aware of what is needed to be done. They have a free option to start with which made the job easier to do. Also nice to have a checklist feature which doesn't get buried in email communications.",Cons: Only trick is getting a bunch of geeks to click the check box when an item is done. Don't think they can help with that. It would also be nice to do a summary of monthly items. But for the price it is hard to beat.
1888,1888 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,4,5,3,4,4,6,“Easy for small teams and projects”,Overall: Planing small projects that don't require complex reporting,3/12/2019,Pros: Its ease of use.

Responsive and well designed.

The interface is easy to understand and easy to explain to new folks as well.,14/10/2019,Pros: The interace was easy to use and had things placed in common sense areas. The items and checkboxes within it are visually appealing and it makes it easy to see things at a glance.,"Cons: I really enjoyed most aspects of this, but the cost per seat seemed high compared to what we actually got out of the software. Especially for a monthly cost. It seemed inflammatory to have it be that much PER PERSON to use."

Asana makes it easy to follow projects, communicate about the status, and track tasks.","Cons: I found the recurring tasks to be clunky and not the best option.

I can share my task list with my team mates and supervisor so they always know what tasks I have completed for the day.","Cons: The comments section doesn't automatically show up.

When we use it, we love it! It is super helpful to have your project management laid out electronically.

However, I feel like it is limited when it comes to larger projects that involve mid-project check-ins, multiple people/departments.

Now that we've used it for almost one year, I can witeness the impact on project flow management was paramount. Among its beneficial side effects, the need to map our projects onto Asana tasks and subtasks helped us a great deal to improve designing projects and activities from the very start so as to make the workflow more efficient and straightforward and identify weak points and potential latencies. Although a few functionalities have room for improvement, Asana is definitely great software.",8/11/2016,,Cons: Print and copy/paste capabilities are quite limited.

Not great as a project management tool. ”,,19/7/2018,,"Cons: Web-based only, and there is no right-click functionality, making it difficult to become a power user. The task hierarchy structure is severely lacking, and has been for years, with seemingly no regard from the Asana team. Views (kanban vs list) are locked when a project is created, meaning you can't swap between views. This is the biggest con in my opinion."

It did a good job tracking, but it was not flexible, features were limited, and frankly it was a bit of a pain to make changes to (or even print from). As long as I limited myself to the online portal, it was wonderful, but I often had to take screenshots of lists if I wanted to print a copy. In addition, you have to setup teams if you want regular updates to go to people - that was a bit of a pain! If you do not require flexibility and want a straightforward place to make to do lists, add files, and monitor a project's status, ASANA will work. Not bad, but not awesome either.",24/1/2017,,

The biggest negative would be that the tool only works when all team members use it. I don't recall there being many videos for tutorials, so that makes the learning curve a little difficult for training new team members."

2262,2262 Asana,Asana,Cara M.,,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,4,5,,,"“We've figured out some great hacks for Asana to work for us, a few features needed yet”","Overall: We have things set up in a really nice, flexible way. I use a technique that the Asana support team told me about that I love - we have a top level project for milestones, and the ""Milestone"" tasks live in the sub projects and in the milestone project. This was hard to discover and feels like ""pro"" usage. That said, now that we have it working I love it. This is very specific, but the one thing we need that doesn't exist yet is a better dashboard screen for looking at the status of the projects, and a team wide dashboard. We have a weekly meeting where everyone updates their red/yellow/green statuses and then we very quickly run through them. The view on the dashboard is not working for us, though. I'd really like to be able to see more of the status message itself, and the burndown chart should be optional (we don't use it at all). If I could turn off the burndown chart and show more of the message, then it would be fantastic. If we could have a team-wide dashboard that would be even better. That's the #1 request. Second, less important request - the ability to nest projects within a team. We've found something that works for us, which is that we have a top level team backlog. Once a task comes up and gets big enough, we break it out into it's own project. We use color to indicate that they are grouped, but nesting would be cool. Also, people complain about Asana being slow a lot. And ++ to the mobile team - I think the iPhone app is great.",3/11/2016,,

It's also incredible hard to get the team to use it at first. The team is not super techy, so it's a bit hard to onboard them because of that as well. In terms of actually usage, I would like to see the subtask in the subtask in the task to be almost like the Apple Finder Column view, where you left to right is how deep the task is. Right now, creating a new subtask in a new subtask replaces the first tasks window."

I love that you can get a tast list of all your pending tasks across projects, OR dive into individual projects and get a ""to do"" list on a project level. It's super easy to create a project template, and copy it across projects to save time for similar projects.","Cons: As a Microsoft project user, I wish Asana had task dependencies and an easier way to view the full list of tasks, sub tasks, etc instead of diving into each task to have to see the sub tasks."

It can be a bear in the middle stages while the team is still half on email (and may never be fully off email due to client communications...), but it's still really useful to have transparent/collaborative communications in the form of comments. Love the ""hearts"" for thank yous and quick acknowledgements. They're continuing to iterate and regularly push out updates, and all the refinements have helped our efficiency.

2309,2309 Asana,Asana,Lisa W.,,Unspecified,2+ years,4,3,5,,,,"“Slightly Confusing, but Powerful Tool”","Overall: With power comes the responsibility to manage the application. Asana provides a lot of flexibility in terms of how to view content, which is sometimes useful and sometimes causes me to hunt around for information or communication. On one hand, it can be a good thing to limit a conversation about a specific task to that task. On the other hand, conversation can evolve in that specific location to related, but separate, subjects, and become hard to find later. If you try to overcome this by using the search bar, you must pay attention to how Asana is filtering the search by default. I tend to put a search term in and hit return, not realizing that Asana is defaulting to ""Tasks I've Assigned to Others"", say. That said, I appreciate the ability to assign a task to an individual, and to follow a task so I'm notified of communication or completion. I wish we were allowed to edit a posted message. I understand that Asana is protecting us against posting a message that gets read by others and then altered later, leaving those others with misinformation, but for me, that protection is outweighed by a need to (sometimes immediately) correct or add to the message. I'd like to decide for myself whether editing my message would result in misinformation or, rather, clarify what's there for my teammates and for the record. The ability to upload files helps me communicate visually and furthers the goal of having a central location for organization of a project.",3/11/2016,,

Our team uses Asana for design-related projects to help our graphic designers stay on track.

It cuts down on the amount of emails that go back and forth while also ensuring that a task doesn't get lost in an email chain somewhere. My only feedback would be to make it so that when you hit ""undo"" or the ""backspace"" key, instead of all your changes reverting to the original only the change you just made would be undone.

The only thing that would improve my day to day work is to have a dashboard that can be seen for all my team members so everybody we can see the status of our projects.

As financial planners, each interaction usually throws up a number of action points, so we turn each meeting into a task with a number of sub-tasks, that all need to be ticked off.

It's easy for tasks and projects to be tucked away and get lost within the murkiness of the software.

The overall organization of the software makes it easy and intuitive to locate tasks,"Cons: I did not like the hidden tasks.

Asana holds it all together.,15/6/2020,"Pros: Asana is where we landed after Basecamp, Slack and Ring Central for managing staff-wide communications and, most importantly, project management. It's a most-in-one telecommuting office solution that keeps us all on track and on the same page.","Cons: Messaging isn't quite up to the sophistication of Slack or Ring Central, but the project management is better than either of those so we've made that compromise."

On its own, it's not very special but the number of integrations makes using it truly remarkable. And it has a great interface.","Cons: I found using it at first to be a bit of a challenge. But once I got used to it, everything went smoothly. While integrations with other apps are a blessing, it can also be a curse as you need a ton of it to make this remotely as functional as you need."

Moreover, i am missing the option to combine the board view with the calendar view, i dont think the two approaches are mutually exclusive. Given these cons i think the software is rather expensive especially for larger teams."

Asana checks all of those boxes.",25/11/2019,"Pros: I appreciate Asana because it helps me manage my work without the need for physical sticky notes, etc. The interface is also very inviting and friendly, not harsh on the eyes, and intuitive for any user.","Cons: A quick con about the interface is that when mass updating tasks, the boxes sometimes update and shift, leaving my next click in the wrong space. Asana would also be a lot more valuable with some kind of time tracker or integration of the sort."
3151,3151 Asana,Asana,Bob S.,IT & Operations Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,4,3,5,10,"“Easy to learn, has the right amount of functionality and keeps things simple ”",Overall: I'm a list and task breakdown person so Asana works the way I do. I find it easier to come back to than other products,7/6/2017,Pros: One of the challenges of desktop project management is getting the team to use the product regularly. Design is a big part of the user experience. Asana's clean design is great to come back to and contributes to user adoption.,"Cons: While it seems like everyone is online all the time, there are times during travel when it's not convenient to log on. Would like to be able to add/change content offline and have it sync when I'm back online."
3152,3152 Asana,Asana,Mary T.,Director of Communications,Health,2+ years,3,3,4,,,7,“Could Be Helpful ”,"Overall: It was fine. The software can be useful, but sometimes these Softwares almost just create too much extra work. I had trouble setting up my account at first, I thought I had finished the process, but it didn't link me with my team. The emails got annoying. We actually don't really use this product anymore at this point. I am sure we will begin to use it again when we hire additional employees.",21/5/2020,Pros: The idea behind this software is a good one despite many other products on the market like this. Being able to chat within the tasks you are assigned to is helpful when multiple people are working together on a task. I find this feature better than just chatting back and forth on emails because they are all stored under the tasks on Asana.,"Cons: The emails you receive from the software are annoying. It seemed like I was getting so many notifications for a few tasks. Reminders about the tasks multiple times a week, notifications about comments, just general emails from Asana, too much. I stopped even looking at them because they became so annoying. Which lead to me using/checking in on the software less."
3153,3153 Asana,Asana,Brad E.,,Self-employed,2+ years,5,5,4,,5,9,“Simple and straightforward project and task management”,,1/6/2017,,"Cons: It's great at task management to keep individuals and teams focused and organized, but likely isn't robust enough to use on it's own for more complex project management. There isn't a great place to capture and report on project data which leaves integration a likely necessity."

It attracts users nicely. Attention is brought where needed quickly. Multiple nesting layers for information make it great for project management and project planning.,"Cons: The Gantt chart is bulky and cumbersome, hard to read and harder to edit from. Email notifications are annoying and hard to disable. Worst of all is the peruser price tag for even incidental users who don't need to log in, but just need to be managed. That alone makes it infeasible for resource planning."
3155,3155 Asana,Asana,Shazal A.,Civil Associate,Civil Engineering,2+ years,5,5,4,,5,10,“Overall - Great”,,7/12/2019,,"Cons: I don't imagine being used when a lot of stories/tasks are created over a period of a long time.

Then I try to cancel it, here is the best part. First, they said I cannot cancel it because I am also have the role of payment authorizer. So, I was asked to assign that role to some one before I cancel it, Then I did exactly as per their instructions, and the cancelled it. Then, when I sent an email to cancel it, they want confirmation from this other person. If someone had an easier way to cancel it, please post.

The color scheme, layout, and font choices are sterile and seem outdated, almost. I know this may seem silly, but make it nice to look at! A clunky plastic piece of technology. Then, in a very basic sense, it's just hard to use. It seems counterintuitive. It's hard to search for things, and find them, and share them, and sort them into various categories or places-- it's as if Asana doesn't explicitly even know it's own purpose or assert it directly enough."

As a small business, it actually is the primary way in which we maintain a Marketing calendar for content. The ability to create different tasks and categories, but have it presented in a master content category has made it incredibly easy for us to track and evaluate the action items. The ability to share and assign projects for content generation and media has proven itself to be invaluable; especially since we only have one dedicated marketing/sales person, who relies on input and materials from other business units.","Cons: I am unsure how Asana Pro operates but currently in the free version we cannot set a status on tasks. We can only mark them as complete, given that we are adapting the software to use for a slightly more narrow purpose, this may not be universally applicable but it would be nice to set task statuses like you can project statuses - indicating if a specific task is at risk of not being completed on-time."

It makes working effective, achieving goals become easier and fast.",8/3/2020,"Pros: Asana is a good tool if you want to manage a team. Since we are on the ages of technological development and many people prefer working remotely, the tool becomes handy for project managers to collaborate with remote workers all over the world.

My only complaint with the system is that it tends to get messy and disorganized once you have conversations back and forth on a task internally. Things tend to get lost in the mix and balls can potentially be dropped. I do enjoy that we are exposed to things in beta to be able to test things out.

The customer service is non-existent.,"Cons: Customer service is non-existent. You have to email them, and wait for a response, which has been up to 48 hours before I've had to email again. Whereas with Wrike, it's 24/7 via phone, email or IM. It isn't fluid, meaning where you change one thing, it changes the rest of the tasks that follow (ie, the name of a task)."

As a podcast company it's easy for us to create templates and subtasks for episode productions and keep everything project related in the ecosystem. I also use Zapier and IFTTT for certain automation pieces. I've been a Basecamp user and then went to Trello and ultimately had Asana just stick. I think it's the best project management tool out there, sure some argue that Trello is better but I've found Asana is more flexible if the team is larger and has repeated tasks like we do.",22/10/2015,Pros: Customer support is excellent and their new UI is nicer on the eyes.,Cons: The mobile app is useful but it's not quite a home run...

I can't imagine how they managed to pack so many controls so compactly into one panel. Another advantage is that the platform can be synchronized with Slack. Due to this, we can not switch between the platform and the messenger.","Cons: I think that the platform is designed for large companies. There are Gantt charts, which are usually used to visualize complex projects with a large number of performers. We do not have such projects, most of the Asana functionality is redundant for us."

And then you can create sub tasks without the task like, ensure all assets are submitted, schedule to publish, schedule to unpublished, etc. Its also great when you need organization in your life!

Without Asana there to keep my organized, I'm certain tasks or duties would have been missed.",12/10/2019,Pros: I really enjoyed the appearance and ease of use that's Asana provided. Multiple columns indicating the various stages of a task or project gave me a comprehensive overview of all my work.,"Cons: The only thing I disliked about Asana was that I felt I didn't use it to its full potential.

It's also very easy to add and remove members from each group.",Cons: It lags quite a bit at times. The UI also can be really hard to deal with when you're on a small screen (too many side menus).

Before I started using the software I did not necessarily have a lot of experiences on it. That is why I had a lot of difficulties getting used to the software and making use of the features the software provided me with. Therefore, I believe it would be very complicated and hard if you are a beginner and it might take a lot of time before you get used to it. I would really like the software to be a little less confusing."

However, it's not part of our main workflow, and if I needed to choose a dedicated PM application I'd probably go in another direction. If you need basic team collaboration, it's a great place to start.",29/12/2018,"Pros: I like that it has a generous free tier that includes team collaboration.

The mainly white and black background is simple and pleasing to look at and the multitude of colors for the various tasks and users adds a fun aspect. I also enjoy how satisfying it is to click the checkmark and see the unicorn fly across the screen.,Cons: It can be hard to navigate and figure out how to find the exact tasks you need. Also the subtasks appear the same as the main tasks so it can be difficult for the assignee of the task to determine which is which without clicking into each task.
3648,3648 Asana,Asana,Dr Joy B.,President/Founder,Accounting,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,5,“Good Software Solution”,Overall: It's a good remote solution but not the best on the market.

There is the ability to create a due date, assign co-workers, check off completed tasks, set recurring tasks, and so much more to stay on top of your to-do list. Emails are sent if a task of overdue. This is a fantastic tool and recommend it to everyone.",Cons: Duplicating tasks and creating subtasks can be a little confusing.
3664,3664 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,,4,9,“Organizing a remote team ”,"Overall: During our team check in calls, we view our project as a team remotely with everything in front of us.

Regardless of where each team member is, it is obvious what the priorities are and who is responsible.","Cons: Being able to move around tasks in order is a little bit tricky to master but, having the ability to assign the priority level is very beneficial."

It has several features which are useful and you can integrate different software in so you can directly link files to team members on the platform.,"Cons: Whilst it is good software, the cost was prohibitive given that there are other platforms out there which are less money but provide the same and in some cases more features."

3678,3678 Asana,Asana,Akshay T.,Chemical Engineer,Automotive,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Best software for planning”,Overall:,21/4/2020,"Pros: I like that this software was very easy to use, and let me create folders for separation. It helped me keep up with my tasks without forgetting about them.",Cons: There was nothing that I did not like about this software. Everything was organized and clean. No issues.

3680,3680 Asana,Asana,Jennifer H.,Adjunct Faculty,Media Production,2+ years,3,3,4,,,5,“The Layout Isn't The Best”,"Overall: I tried to use it to help me schedule my content, but it hasn't been easy enough for me to use or else I would use it all the time. It helps me organize what I want to do, but it's difficult to go back into the software and find what I've written down.",10/4/2020,"Pros: I like that it is easy to sign up and that I can access it from my laptop, desktop and cell phone. I also like that it was free to try.","Cons: I do NOT like the calendar. It's difficult to find my tasks after I have put them on a date. When I go back into the program, it's like my tasks have somehow disappeared."
3681,3681 Asana,Asana,Oliver S.,Assistant to Fashion Director at GQ Style,Publishing,2+ years,3,4,3,4,3,6,“Asana in my eyes”,Overall: I would recommend Asana to friends at small start up companies. I believe Asana can be extremely positive for smaller companies or larger companies with individual teams.,26/3/2019,Pros: The software is fantastic for keeping up to date with you tasks. After/during a Monday morning weekly briefing with you team you are able to set each of your team members tasks with deadlines and micro manage these as well as stay on top of everything your team are doing. It is also great for keeping on top of your own work.,"Cons: Like all ways of making a to do list, you have you manually write out your own tasks when you receive them. It allows a break down in communication when senior members of staff give others tasks instead talking through tasks, nurturing and developing their staff. This would only be the case if you had poor managers or a very large number of staff. It is not the most simple to use, but once you get the hang of it, it is fine. There are always different levels to tasks and there are not to tasks you set on Asana."
3682,3682 Asana,Asana,Tom Y.,Senior Front-End Developer,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Excellent for tasks individually and in temas”,Overall: We've been very happy with Asana and we have found it pretty easy to use. The options for collaborating are nice and important to our team.,16/4/2019,Pros: It's excellent at creating tasks and reminders for those annoying repetitive tasks but also single tasks that you don't want to handle in a ticket system. It's easy to setup and use. The free version really also do a lot of the job and you can always consider upgrading later if you feel a need for it. You can also integrate it into different programs etc.,Cons: You need to get used to the layout a bit but it's very fast. The repetitive tasks can also be a bit hard to figure out how to set the first time but it's very easy after that.
3683,3683 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Outsourcing/Offshoring,2+ years,4,5,5,4,5,9,“Easy to use”,,26/12/2018,,Cons: I cannot think of any cons at the moment.

3687,3687 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Biotechnology,2+ years,2,,,,,,“Not really a fan..”,"Overall: After over a year the enthusiasm has faded into clutter. It may not be Asana's fault, but as a tool to be more organized in your projects it has failed under weight of overloaded people that have too little time to address another tool that seems more like extra work than work reduction. It may be that I expect too much, but I cannot assess loading of resources from this tool and that's what's needed to explain the issue to investors and CEOs. The data put in by users is too easily lost and hard to fit into the bigger picture. There's no help in shuffling priority on the fly for projects and little view of when resources aren't available or buried. Documents that are uploaded are often lost in cyberspace, if they are expected to be reviewed or shared and the email link is lost, good luck finding them.",26/1/2016,,
3688,3688 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Health,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Asana”,Overall: An issue that Asana has overcome is the ability to break down tasks and make it easy to follow and use the system to avoid overwhelm for myself and employees,18/12/2018,Pros: Great way to track projects and the ease of breaking tasks down into smaller subtasks is great. Visually easy on the eyes and great allocation of tasks to other team members,"Cons: At the moment, no cons have been identified."

The ""search"" feature works well to find documents and tasks. Tagging coworkers is nice and easy.","Cons: Sometimes the data you input seems like it goes on forever without any clear divide of the ""tasks"". The dialogue within a tasks does have much customizing and can get pretty long which increases the chance of missing something."

Easy to onboard users.,13/4/2020,Pros: Love the simplistic view of task lists and the ability to share amongst the rest of the team. Also like the different view capabilities,Cons: Would like it to be a smoother experience with calendar app. Other than that there is not much this is missing for the price point.
3695,3695 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Apparel & Fashion,2+ years,4,5,4,,,10,“So Easy to Understand”,"Overall: Asana is perfect for organizing a team or even your own personal workflow. I have a coworker who uses it for her daily tasks and larger projects, and I am envious of how she does it.",23/5/2019,"Pros: I have fallen in love with this platform since I've been using it to manage my website build. It's simple, clean, and for me it's intuitive. I've used Trello in the past and Asana seems much more user friendly.","Cons: The background choices for your personal dashboard make the interface feel extremely busy and made me kind of nauseous. There aren't any solid colors to choose from. So it's either a nature-related background, or white. They should make this an option."
3696,3696 Asana,Asana,Usman K.,Software Engineer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,4,,,9,“Very good tool for task management”,Overall:,28/2/2020,"Pros: You can create and assign tasks, track stuff, it will remind you when project deadlines are getting close. It is similar to JIRA but for more human stuff. Although I am sure you can use Asana for some technical tasks as well.","Cons: Asana does require somebody to keep you accountable to your tasks, just like with any task tool. It does give you reminders, but there has to be a project manager."

So far it pretty much does whatever we need and may have to upgrade for more features in the future
3699,3699 Asana,Asana,Edel Alberto H.,programador php,Computer Software,2+ years,3,3,4,4,3,7,“asana why use it”,"Overall: just use asana as a user, not as an admin but I can say it works pretty well for what was viewed.",21/12/2018,"Pros: is very powerful for organizing projects, allows you to manage time and generate productivity graphs",Cons: can become too restrictive in its version and you need to buy a new license if you need to manage resources

Once you get the hang of it, it is very effective. I wish it had similar formatting features like MS word, especially when you have to cut and past items from another tool over here you loose the formatting. I haven't contacted customer service so far so I can't say much about it.",11/5/2015,,

Really helpful to us,12/12/2019,"Pros: The ability to create projects, share them with collaborators and yet still manage to keep everything organised is a dream. The alternate views of the project makes life really simple, as a lot of the time we need to look at projects in timeline views and dependancy views, while other times its really helpful seeing the tasks in a card layout view.","Cons: It's not really a gripe, but the fact that there is no 'offline' or locally installed app makes it tricky to use on the road.

You are able to leave comments and see communications from others that are working on the project with you.","Cons: What I like least about this software is the customer service. Many times the customer service line can keep you on the phone for long periods of time without actually fixing your issue. With that being said, if you ever have a software glitch you should leave enough time to call their customer service."

Also, the number of features available to non-paying accounts is great. You are able to make several projects, invite several team members, set deadlines. For a small team with small to medium-size projects, the non-paid version is really all you need.","Cons: I had no way of confirming whether my team members were getting the assignments and reminders. When deadlines were not met, was that the fault of the system not reminding my team or was my team simply running behind? Also, I would have loved for Asana to integrate with my Microsoft calendar so all my reminders would be in the same place. I personally, would have also liked a Ghant chart, but really, I just love Ghant charts."

We were all in college and didn't work at the same times even though we shared marketing creation responsibilities,"Cons: They send you emails a few times a week that are not related to the project you have active.

I was reluctant to give up what I was using to manage my work, but since this was going to be a place for me to work alongside someone else I thought I should give it a go. I felt like there was some potential there, and we used it for a while, but his workflow changed and he dropped it. I had already ported all my timeline into Asana and was left working in it alone. The extra effort to master the UI and train myself to adapt my workflow to match Asana was not worth it if I was to be working alone.

I could do this because of Asana's templates that are still very customizable.,5/5/2020,"Pros: Asana is very easy to customize to one's needs. I didn't need it to run a large organization, but I started it for myself because as a manager I have so many tasks to keep track of and two departments to monitor. I created it for myself but as my team grows, I can easily add them and we can easily see each other's progress. I like that you can add files to the tasks too, so you don't have to go searching elsewhere or email someone to find a document.","Cons: It took me a while to wrap my mind around ways that I could use this, how the whole map is arranged, but after some searching, I was able to find a master layout of how Asana is mapped."

For almost 2 year I ran a small collaborative using Asana. My wife and I use it for everything from grocery lists to who's packing what for vacations. At a certain point though Asana becomes more cumbersome when you are working in diverse areas. And we had problems trying to keep it simple enough for clients to be on and track progress.

Personally I feel that it is not necessary. I have my own handwritten checklist to remind me of what I need to do and use conversation to pass along that information to the other members of the team. The one place that I have found it to be helpful is in accumulating information: my team works with videos and there is a set of metrics that goes with each video and we use an Asana tasklist to keep them straight...however, that is not really its intended use I don't think, as it is more used for a bulletin board of things that have happened rather than as a tasklist of things to come. It is a fine product, and my bosses seem to love it, but I rarely contribute to it or even look at it because I know what I'm working on and what is coming up for me and don't need to be told through an app. I don't mean to be negative, I think I am just not the target audience.",10/11/2016,Pros: The framed layout is ok,"Cons: constant notifications and reminders, though I ended up turning them off."

I also did not like that you do not have the option to hide team members from the sidebar. I do not like that you can not buy this service for just one person. The minimum is 5.

The ability to create separate lists for individual projects is extremely useful, while at the same time being able to see one giant list of things you wish you didn't have to do, but must because that's how we get paid. The absolute icing on the cake are the periodic celebrations that dance across your screen when you check of items. My only critique is that I don't see them often enough.

Every time I see an Asana URL I think twice before clicking on it due to having to deal with a loading screen for what feels like forever for a to-do list. Instead I commonly go over to my one sanctioned Asana tab and search for the task there to avoid the pain. Asana is commonly used as an argument against single page frontends around the office. On a similar topic: the URLs themselves are sometimes problematic. As they encode the enclosing context of a task I will frequently end up in a member of my team's personal task list after following a URL they have sent me.",3/11/2016,Pros: Flexibility.

It's a great way to organize tasks and keep on track. However, the customer support is pretty non-existent, though the online help docs are pretty useful for most things. It also lacks a few key features that would make it non-useable for many types of businesses (i.e. task dependencies that adjust due dates based on tasks ahead of them, task time projections, etc).

To be efficient, Asana needs to connect to your email (for alerts when outside the platform) and your calendar, two applications you're already using.

It's definitely not worse either.",31/8/2019,"Pros: Multiple projects from different users can be managed and easily accessed within the platform as well as multiple projects for the same user.

Instead asking someone to do something through email, which could easily get lost you can assign them a task, which will remind them when the task is due.",Cons: What I like least is it does not tell you when someone completes a task that you assigned to them.

As a freelancer, I use Asana to assign tasks to my team members, and it just makes the whole thing easier than imagined.

Asana will be capable of providing various members of your organization with the project management tools they need to manage teams and timelines, provided that they are able to learn the system effectively. Users and managers who expect Asana can be picked up quickly and leveraged properly will be unsatisfied, though, as the product has a steep learning curve to overcome the variety of features offered in the product.",11/4/2019,"Pros: The first thing you notice when you open Asana is an absolute boatload of different project management features. Mostly nestled in the task management category, these system allow Project/Implementation managers to create timelines, assign proper tasks, create tickets in other platforms like JIRA, and get notifications to help keep you and others on track. The huge amount of organizational tools will allow for most project managers to find the tools that benefit them most.","Cons: Asana is definitely a victim of it's own size and capability. The myriad features offered in the system are intimidating at first, and will often require a human teaching another to master the applications' capabilities and potential.

A project can be built as a list, or a kanban board, and there are progress updates, and conversations, and regular comments on the cards. Tasks be marked Done or be in a Done column state...

It allows me to brainstorm with particular team members about ideas in a shared way.

We often comment in the wrong place, or add titles to the wrong place. Sounds stupid, but makes information confusing quickly. It's only because it's a powerful tool that allows for a lot of function, but if the task is simpler there is no basic version which removes options. For that, we use Trello."

I'd like an option to keep the tasks that are complete visible, so I feel like I'm accomplishing things, rather than just making the list shorter, which is hard to tell on bigger projects."

5069,5069 Asana,Asana,Audrey M.,Ecology PhD Student,Higher Education,2+ years,3,2,4,,,5,“Feels jarring and invasive to some”,,20/8/2018,,"Cons: Implementing Asana seemed to tell people, ""You know your time management techniques that you began developing in junior high, the first time you ever wrote yourself a to-do list? You've been doing it wrong. You know the fundamental limits to your productivity that you have explored and tested and worked to gently expand for years? You can work harder."" We did not get this kind of pushback with Trello. I wish I could tell you why the reaction was so different, but I think it has to do with the number of features. It was impossible to go from zero to Asana."

It is also nice to see projects other depeartments are working on and seeing their progress.",Cons: My least favorite part of Asana is the lack of automation. It would work better for me if I could start a task and it automatically gets moved to a different stange when a certain date occurs to make sure I am on track.

Keeping tasks oriented by project is great. The file sharing system is very useful.,Cons: I do not like the communication aspect of asana. The messaging system is clunky and sometimes hard to follow. The calendar is limited to a monthly view and it would be great to be able to narrow it to a weekly or daily view. It feels like it could use some more UX work.

Asana was ultimately too complex for our (very) small team, so we went with a different solution, although Asana itself was great. We just needed something more basic and inexpensive."

There is not limit to the number of projects, tasks, or boards, which is amazing.

I can leave comments in the task for my team. I am able to set a due date and delegate certain team members to the task.,Cons: Sometimes duplicate tasks are created by members and I am not able to merge them to the original task that was set up so I have to transpose comments and delete the duplicate task.

Difficult to carry on group conversation, forces you to leave main page to conduct ongoing conversation or sidebar comments."
5102,5102 Asana,Asana,Timothy W.,VP of Development,E-Learning,2+ years,5,4,5,,,10,“Integrating with Asana has made tasks easier”,"Overall: Our company travels to trade shows a dozen+ times a year. Each trade show prep is identical (registering, ordering supplies, booking travel, shipping materials, etc), but the location and dates change. Each team member has specific responsibilities, but the task was literally a manilla envelope that gets passed around. We switched to Asana and set up the ""project"" and duplicated it for each show. All team members get live updates anytime anything happens, whether they are looking at their phone or at their work station. It provides more clarity and allows everyone to see where their shows are at and what still needs to be completed for each show. We love using this compared to our old manual system.",8/1/2019,"Pros: The features I love are the live updates, the task completion dates, the notes, and file uploads","Cons: I wish there was a better place to put a large paragraph description for the tasks, or make past projects a little more sortable/organizable. I would also like to import/forward emails them to specific tasks in a project."

Most software companies do not offer this. I feel so organized and in control by using Asana.,"Cons: The one thing I wish was different, was that if you set up different workspaces, you can't see all your tasks for the day from all the workspaces together. You have to switch between them to see your tasks for the day. I wish you could view them across all workspaces."
5105,5105 Asana,Asana,April V.,Dir of social media,Unspecified,2+ years,3,4,3,4,1,7,“Easy to use software that offers a lot of nice feautures for project management”,,6/7/2018,,Cons: A few of the good features require the paid versiona and the current price is not worth the cost now.
5106,5106 Asana,Asana,Oliver S.,Product Manager,Biotechnology,2+ years,5,5,4,3,5,8,“Excellent for small teams”,Overall: We use Asana to track tasks for individual employees and business areas. For example please we plan our monthly marketing tasks in Asana and keep track of which have been completed to feed back into future planning . We also use automated task creation for different triggers such as website forn submissions to ensure they are followed up.,8/1/2019,Pros: As a makes it super easy to keep track of I going tasks and projects. I particularly like the links with automation software to create tasks from triggers.,Cons: The push notifications from the app seem to stack up and go off all at once rather than in real time.
5107,5107 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,3,3,3,3,3,5,"“Using Asana is not too difficult, but somehow the UX is a little prohibitive...”",Overall: It's fairly decent at managing simple graphic design projects. It helps our team streamline its processes to a degree and gives us a central point to look at for information,21/6/2018,"Pros: We like the fact that we can search by project title, and it almost always brings up the right one, but sometimes it just doesn't find it.","Cons: Honestly, a lot of projects (especially digital marketing projects) still need to be entered in freeform using our own ad hoc writing, and sometimes (since project managers don't always know how tactics work in marketing), this leaves the transmission of information still open to human error. Might be better if the projects had some pre-set fields that were defined by tactic."
5108,5108 Asana,Asana,Daisy C.,Research & Sales Manager,11-50 employees,2+ years,4,4,3,3,4,8,"“Very good platform, easy to use and helps a good work flow”",Overall: It helped me organize with my work group the pending assignments and thus I got a better flow within the organization of the company.

Fast and responsive The free version supports up to 15 team members. It is also very easy to use.,Cons: It is not ideal for graphics-intensive projects. does not have desktop applications so it's not easy to access.

Even if you get the basics, then you have to make sure that your colleagues do to - which overall prolongs the process of having that implemented."
5110,5110 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Cosmetics,2+ years,4,3,4,,5,7,“Very good creative project managing tool ”,Overall: I used to use Asana on a daily basis until the company I work for switched it to Monday. I feel both tools are similar in terms of functionality and features. I like them both.,2/1/2019,Pros: I really like Asana's design! I love the calendar view where you can easily overview all your projects and tasks. I've started using Asana to plan my company's Social Media Calendar and it's perfect for it. You can easily share projects and distribute tasks to your team.,"Cons: I wish it would be easier to edit files, similar to Google Docs, or something. That'd be perfect!"

Gives you the ability to set deadlines, assign projects to specific team members, add notes, attachments, etc. It also allows you to see the history of the project and what date it was created, updated, completed, etc. I like how there are a lot of customized fields making it work for each organization's unique needs.",Cons: The search feature is a little difficult to understand. I don't like that you can't assign projects to multiple team members.

5115,5115 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Higher Education,2+ years,5,5,4,5,4,8,“Great for small or mid sized projects”,,7/6/2018,,Cons: I wish they had some time of timeline view on the free plan so you can easily see stuff that are more time sensitive.
5116,5116 Asana,Asana,James H.,CEO,Staffing and Recruiting,2+ years,4,4,3,4,5,8,“Leading the way in project management”,,15/2/2018,,"Cons: There are some great features, I wouldn't, however, recommend paying for the premium unless you are a very heavy user. Basic gets you most of what you need."

5119,5119 Asana,Asana,"Darrell ""Jeremy"" F.",Cofounder and CTO,Unspecified,2+ years,5,4,4,,,,“Great software for keeping track of things!”,,5/6/2018,,"Cons: It is a little limiting - It's hard to use this for growing teams or increasing detail of task. I typically graduate to Trello when I need to manage items that have more than one status state, and need to keep better track of things across people."
5120,5120 Asana,Asana,Djohn T.,SEO-analyst,1-10 employees,2+ years,4,4,3,5,3,7,“Maybe it's worth looking for something better”,,15/2/2018,,"Cons: For teams in which more than 15 people work, you will have to buy a paid version of the software product. And with its shortcomings it is hardly worth paying even the small amount that owners want."
5121,5121 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Construction,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,,“Easy to collaborate”,,25/6/2018,,Cons: I find that the list or board function is quite restrictive as you can't switch back between the two once you've selected one for easy list management.
5122,5122 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Public Relations and Communications,2+ years,4,4,5,,,8,“Asana Review”,,13/12/2018,,"Cons: Perhaps the worst thing about Asana is that it does not tend to be a program that anyone can use. Having a defined target (entrepreneurs above all), then it can not generate a bit of complications for other authors who may not be familiar with this work tool, and even less, if they do not know about the technological bets that are being handled to date. . However, its simple platform has no loss, so Asana is undoubtedly a great application."
5123,5123 Asana,Asana,Martin S.,Institute Relations Associate,Unspecified,2+ years,5,4,5,5,,,“I have been using Asana since roughly 2012 and it has improved a lot over the years. Would recommend.”,,5/6/2018,,Cons: Can get a little tricky to get the hang of and to teach others. But it's pretty easy once you get the hang of it. It's like snowboarding.
5124,5124 Asana,Asana,James G.,Developer,Computer Software,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,9,"“Easy to use, good notifications”","Overall: Easy to use, great for viewing assigned tasks and communicating about those tasks.",14/2/2018,Pros: I got added onto an Asana project and was easily able to learn how to use it. I received an email for each task assigned to me and then was able to view them in my tasks list. The ability to upload and download files has also been super useful.,"Cons: Its a little more complex than say, Trello, so it takes more time to learn. But overall its not that bad to get used to."
5125,5125 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,4,5,5,4,10,“Greta project management/collaboration software”,,12/6/2018,,"Cons: It is a bit bulky, just like any sophisticated software. it does so much that there is a bit of a learning curve; however, you are constantly finding new features, assets, etc, that make this software well worth the time and effort it takes to use it."
5126,5126 Asana,Asana,Laura H.,Virtual Personal Assistant,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,9,“Asana makes task management and delegation easy”,Overall: I love using Asana to organize everything that needs to be done and by whom. The new edition of the cute graphic rewards after finishing tasks keeps things positive and are a great way to put a little smile on my face to celebrate a job well done.,10/12/2018,Pros: Being able to assign projects and tasks to individuals or teams,Cons: I can get lost in assigning things to people and spend a lot of time inputing information

5128,5128 Asana,Asana,Dylan E.,Software Programmer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,3,2,3,4,4,5,"“An adequate web application for project management, hindered by a confusing interface.”","Overall: A pretty, albeit hard to setup, visualization tool for project management tracking.",7/2/2018,"Pros: The interface is very clean and professional looking. Due to its online nature, it is great that the contents are accessible on every mobile device I own. The application is free to use.","Cons: The interface suffers from a problem with user-friendliness, with mouse clicks often not doing exactly what you expect them to (clicking outside the border of a task makes you set up a new one and not move back to the main screen, for instance). You cannot create your own project categories and have them work easily with filtering or setting up current task and future tasks. You cannot drag tasks to another category. All in all it is a hassle to create or manage tasks, even though the visualization after you are done is very helpful."
5129,5129 Asana,Asana,Zuleida S.,University professor,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,4,4,,,“good management tool.”,,11/6/2018,,"Cons: Regarding the economic aspect, although there are trial versions, I do not like that the cost depends on the number of team members."

And you cannot designated the task to specific person for a particular task."

5132,5132 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Internet,2+ years,4,4,4,5,,,“Reasonably good project management tool”,,25/1/2018,,"Cons: For granular campaign management when running an agency business we ended up too deep in the weeds for Asana to be our go-to tool (ended up using AirTable). However, I think for many businesses it's more than enough"
5133,5133 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,4,3,4,5,5,4,"“Lots of features, takes some getting used to.”",,5/6/2018,,Cons: Took a while to get used to. Seems like there were multiple places to store the same data which resulted in some duplication of efforts.

I have learned a thing or two about how to design support from them.",5/12/2018,,"Cons: Overall a great product with nice features, the con is that some of our users have had a hard time getting up to speed on what a project is versus a card, wish a card could be a project as well."
5135,5135 Asana,Asana,Manny J.,Director of Strategic Initiatives,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Best Project Management - Simply Powerful”,,8/5/2018,,"Cons: Wished could see the subtasks under tasks, but can understand and appreciate subtasks showing up in the sidebar."

It has projects, tasks, and sub-tasks, all of which can be assigned to a person/group, and given a due date. E-mail notifications can be set to keep team members up to date.","Cons: I wish Asana had a desktop app. It is quite burdensome to have to keep a browser window on Asana at all times. I am still a somewhat new user, so haven't run into any other issues."
5137,5137 Asana,Asana,Russell C.,Email Developer,Religious Institutions,2+ years,3,3,3,3,3,7,“Okay Task Management”,Overall: Ability to coordinate between departments easier.,5/6/2018,"Pros: We use Asana a lot for divvying up a task and having other departments collaborate as well. It's great for keeping things updated. The best feature is the importance feature, or priority. You can label things as a high priority so other departments or team members know it needs to be done first. Really helps to hit deadlines and to emphasize what needs to get done.",Cons: Sometimes it gets messy. There are a lot of ways to organize but if you get hit with a bunch of task at once then you'll get a messy homepage.

This is my favorite software outside of zoom. It just works,5/12/2018,Pros: If you are running a high functioning team that is trying to manage a ton of projects or if you are just managing one this is the tool. I have yet to find a better project management solution that also centralizes communication and keeps things out of my email inbox and centralized within tasks/projects The integration with everhour for time tracking is also really helpful.,Cons: Reporting needs some work. Clean up (like most systems) requires diligence.
5139,5139 Asana,Asana,Victor S.,Owner-Operator at Animity Community Health and Wellness Center,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,4,3,,,"“Great free platform for small businesses, upstarts, individuals for project management”",,7/5/2018,,"Cons: It seems like it's difficult to pick both tasks and cards. The menu is a bit cumbersome, especially on the mobile app. I usually am brought to a list of tasks that I don't care to work with, and I have to search around on the app to find the project I want to work on. It seems like it isn't very intuitive in that way on the app. The online web platform is a bit better as far as intuitive, and you can't beat free for the introductory price."
5140,5140 Asana,Asana,ken y.,marketing manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,3,4,4,,,7,“To-do Checklist Management”,,15/12/2017,,Cons: Would like to have some type of instant chat feature with collaborators. More dashboard views and insights into projects falling behind schedule.

After you get the hang of it, I have no complaints. My suggestion is to provide more support during the on-boarding process."
5143,5143 Asana,Asana,Ryan M.,Insurance Agent,Insurance,2+ years,5,4,5,4,4,8,“Easy to use Project planner with a ton of features”,Overall: Great features and ability to work on projects as a team is a massive benefit.,27/4/2018,Pros: Easy to use and to collaborate with others on a team. Easily assign tasks to others and share the progress with others in real time.,Cons: We never had any cons while using this program. We did the free trial and really liked it but haven't pulled the trigger to fully implement it in our office. Urging upper management to do so though.
5144,5144 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Human Resources,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“My favourite project management tool”,,16/11/2017,,"Cons: I've had issues in the last couple of weeks with stuff not saving. I contacted customer support and they've opened a ticket, so hopefully it gets resolved"
5145,5145 Asana,Asana,Luke F.,Web Developer,Recreational Facilities and Services,2+ years,4,5,3,4,3,6,"“It's a pretty nice organizer, but doesn't seem to be worth the price tag”","Overall: Easy organization, quick task lists, sharing task lists, recording of various meetings and ideas",14/5/2018,"Pros: It's go a really easy and intuitive interface. It's really great for collaboration and teams to get on the same page and have a single location of all tasks. You can also assign and delegate tasks between the users of a team, which is pretty slick and makes assigning responsibilities very easy.","Cons: If you use agile or scrum, Asana can work for you, but other, possibly free, tools will work much better. We use it as a secondary management tool because of that. It's very slick and easy for what it does, but I haven't seen it do all that much."
5146,5146 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Games,2+ years,4,4,4,,,5,"“A very zen approach to project & task management, not the best for creatives though”","Overall: It's a nice piece of software for keeping your team working in sync with one another, it just wasn't the best fit for our team.",29/11/2018,"Pros: I really liked how non-overwhelming the user interface was. It was easy to add tasks and prioritize and assign them, and I like the networked team feel. I liked that I could comment on things and so could my teammates.","Cons: There's not really any accountability unless you have a dedicated person overseeing everything like a hawk. For us it was too easy for stuff to slip through the cracks, but part of that comes from having a lot of creatives and less administrative people on staff than most teams."
5147,5147 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,4,3,4,4,4,7,“Great for Organizations and Personal Task Management”,"Overall: Clear check-list formatting, once you get used to the shortcuts and workflows its pretty easy to create tasks, assign ownership, set deadlines in a readily sharable, visible way.",25/4/2018,Pros: - Can simply use it as a personal to do list - Nice and easy mobile app. - Ability to keep all of our individual and group tasks and projects in one place and easy to manage. - Very user friendly and keeps us all on the same page.,Cons: - Could use some offline support - Initial setup is bit complicated. It can be bit difficult to figure out; there's quite a learning curve when you're just starting out. - The ease of editing has few setbacks.

Assigning tasks to colleagues is easy. The notifications are helpful and not overbearing.,"Cons: Monitoring progress of tasks isn't very detailed. It often feels like extra work to manage simple tasks in Asana, rather than just a basic to do list. Getting company buy-in has been difficult, so it tends to only be effective for certain groups."
5149,5149 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,4,5,2,,,“My experience in this software was excellent ”,,10/5/2018,,Cons: What I didny dislike about the platform is the that messages are deleted after the quota is reached and this very irritating

5153,5153 Asana,Asana,Zack L.,Merchant Success Manager,Internet,2+ years,5,5,5,5,,10,“Asana is an excellent task-management software that can be used inter-departmentally in a company.”,Overall: It's super easy to get on top of an internal to-do list that can be shared cross-departmentally with Asana. I appreciate it for that.,4/5/2018,"Pros: I like the way tasks are structured in a way that I would structure them myself, by hand. As in, they're in a list. Typical task management software like Trello uses ""boards,"" and while that's useful in its own, I find the list view of Asana to be extremely easy to pick up and run with.","Cons: If you're picking up Asana for the first time and you're entering into a team environment that's been up and running for awhile, it can be daunting to know how to get started or where to head.

One of my companies used this and it was not very user friendly. I believe the purpose of the calendars should be public throughout the whole company rather than just yourself. If you are managing a project with everyone, people should have visibility. I just feel like it made more work to be on this app and it was very forgetful so people would forget to log in and update."

However, we noticed that many of our employees who initially requested the software were not regularly using it. It was hard for us to get usage reports from Asana to assess value per seat that we were paying for; when we did dig in and check with employees, a large chunk had not adopted the software to manage their workflows. In short, some employees will be enthusiastic adopters and others will underutilize the tool. Checking into the data can help you save on seats.",11/1/2017,,

Keeps everything more organized that most traditional pen-and-paper methods. Helps teams coordinate between tasks.,"Cons: Major bugs and scaling issues. Lots of creating tasks and constant errors (e.g., multiple times a task I created error'd out when trying to save). Basic feature set that I think JIRA or Trello does better for the price.

The process feels very organic. It takes away many of the pain points I feel about things like JIRA.,"Cons: Some of the little details hurt. You can make a project a list or a kan ban board, but you can't switch between the two. You now have text formatting (yay!) bit there's no formatting option for code snippets, which seemed obvious as a value add."

5188,5188 Asana,Asana,Ihsaan M.,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,3,5,,,9,"“Asana delivers, but definitely has a bit of a learning curve”","Overall: I used Asana as part of a publications team briefly to help us all stay on the same page managing our workflow. What I noticed immediately was that the email notifications settings combined the best of both worlds. By default, all replies to conversations are sent both to the platform and through email. Furthermore, individual team members can respond directly to the message in the same email thread. What this means is that team member who was a little less technology literate could communicate fluidly with very little onboarding. That being said, once you sign into the platform itself, the user interface can be a bit overwhelming and tough to navigate, which is the case for most of these solutions until you learn your way around. I'd say that the robust features and functionality definitely outweigh the learning curve, so I highly recommend.",5/1/2017,,

It is among the most intuitive and easy-to-use programs I've used professionally, and it avoids complexity by doing one simple, basic thing. Creating projects and tasks, assigning those tasks, and tracking status, is all very easy and transparent. The task management in Asana involves basic lists. Each task gets a name, a description, and a field for comments. All changes, comments, and conversations are sent to one clean inbox. It's even possible to run simple and thorough reports on all projects in the system. My only minor gripes are that it lacks a few features that, while aren't deal breakers, would be useful for project management. One is that there's no easy way to sort projects. We have a project list nearly a hundred long, and we have to manually sort them as we add new ones. Additionally, there's no direct way to track time spent. It does have integration with Harvest Time Tracking (which is nice), but it's not a native function.",14/12/2016,,

I like how it allows you to create sub-tasks and assign each task to a person with a due date, and you can make the due date recur every week. month etc. I have set up many recurring tasks. My favorite feature that you can turn on is ""Unicorns"" - which makes a unicorn or other magical creature go across your screen when you check off that you have completed certain tasks.

It's a great tool to keep track of progress on our various day to day tasks. Copying and creating tasks could not be easier. Their platform is great for beginner and advanced project management software users. My only concern with Asana is its slowness. Sometimes, when creating or copying a project, the load times are a bit excessive. I know this isn't caused by my internet connection because we have great speeds at the office.",16/1/2017,,

Right now the only improvement I can think of is with the templates being in beta - it would be great for us to have our own library of templates that we can create. I know we can sort of do this by creating a project and just copying it but one constant issue that we run into with that is a lot of time people will accidentally make edits to the template project and not the copied version. By allowing us to add to our own organizations library of templates (the same library that you created for us in the beta) it could help prevent the above issue.,3/11/2016,Pros: Robust and flexible management system.,Cons: Very minor kinks in usability with some of the new features currently being released in beta (but they are in beta after all).

It's pretty intuitive (at least to me) yet has a lot of features that make it possible to manage more complex projects and workflows. I use it a lot for creating web pages on our website and managing our editorial calendar which involves a lot of work from other members of my team and Asana helps me delegate subtasks for each piece of content we publish, and track its status easily. I also love the custom fields feature (premium only -- but totally worth it if your company's willing to pay) so I can quickly mark a piece as staged / published / etc. and know at a glance where every piece of content is at.",19/12/2016,,

Seriously, anyone can understand the basics very very quickly. UX is great. Good integration with Slack.",Cons: The way Asana is built can create a chaos. I had many times I couldn't find past tasks so I had make a new one. Asana tasks and github branches don't always align so it creates mess too. Communication could be a mess too as people could comment in tasks and subtasks which are seperate conversations.

They also offer a generous trial program for small teams, making it easier to justify upgrading as your team grows.",9/11/2016,"Pros: Features, ease of use, overall design","Cons: Can get a little ""busy"" at time it's almost too flexible in the ways in which you can input or access information."

The interface is good looking and elegant, and I can see how it would be pleasing to use it every day.

Our designers are able to come in each day and understand what they need to work on, how much time they have to complete, and when it's due. As the project manager, there are some things I like about Asana and some I don't: I appreciate the search functionality; it allows me to drill down to the exact information I need for resourcing. I do not appreciate the team functionality. While we do work on teams, a lot of our projects are cross-team efforts so having a project fall under one team doesn't always make sense.

Additional functions make it rather deep, such as being able to crosspost tasks to multiple projects and have granular levels of permission. Their strong involvement with an avid developer community extends Asana to be far broader than its functions out of the box. As with any tool, it can be stretch too far. But if you are willing to keep streamlined assignments and tasks, this is a great way to do it. Image a task list where each task is actually a thread, where comments and attachments can show up inline.

Asana allow us to get this on paper and sync it with Sunrise Calendar (through Google apps).

Helpful new feature that makes project boards look a lot like Trello if you wish, otherwise it's more of a list.","Cons: Duplication of project limitations, not the best for visual navigation, limitations in email notifications, self-training means needing to have a lot of time to figure things out. Inability to edit a comment after being posted in a task is beyond annoying. Overall, it doesn't keep the team as organized as a software like this should, but at the same time, each person tried organizing their projects their own way, which made it confusing on other members. The only way Asana would work out for our team is if there were rules on layout and assigning tasks properly,."

5394,5394 Asana,Asana,David H.,Marketing Strategist,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,3,5,5,5,8,“Versatile Tool”,"Overall: Asana is great. Their strength is probably a bit of their weakness though. Asana can do so many things that it can be hard to know where to start or how to use it for your purposes. That said, if you work with customer support and read through the documentation you should be able to figure it out.",3/11/2016,Pros: Versatility. You can do a lot with Asana. Sometimes it just feels like too much. :),Cons: Onboarding was a struggle. Seems like a good starting point would be starting with the types of tasks that suit each type of feature.

I love Kanban board style project management which is what made me try out Asana in the first place. Setup is nice and easy, so as a new user you are able to get going fairly quickly, and the free version gives you just enough.","Cons: So I'm not sure if this is a limitation of the free version or if that's just how it works, but when moving a task to the completed board it doesn't automatically mark the task as completed, so I still have to mark it after moving it over.

It's not terribly slow, but sometimes you sit waiting either because there are too many to do items or Chrome is simply a memory hog (Mac Air, 2013 model). But their Customer Service is pretty good, very helpful. Their billing is weird, too. The rates go *up* as you add users, rather than economies of scale. That makes it difficult to add users."

Most apps are either the former or the latter and rarely I find an app which I can truly say has both qualities. Asana is simple to use - it has a simple user interface and it works like a text editor, which means, you type in a new task and when you are done you just hit enter to add a new task. What makes Asana powerful is the ever growing set of features and functionalities it offers. Asana is simple, which makes it useful even if you don't work in a team and utilize it as a personal task management. On the other hand, it is powerful enough to be used in any size of team and organization.",24/1/2016,Pros: Ease of use Features and functionality Can be used for personal task management or for teams Free to use for teams of up to 15 members,"Cons: Mobile app is not as simple and powerful in comparison with its desktop version, although it seems to be getting better."

Whenever we have to deal with a new project it always seems to be too overwhelming to break down every single part of a huge project into tasks where one person is responsible. So, in this way Asana starts to feel more like an email replacement (which is great) than an overall project manager. We then resort to using it when the project has been understood and only lacks details and tasks to be completed, I don't know if this is a good thing or not, but I would sure love to see what a complete solution looks like.",17/9/2015,"Pros: Each task has one person responsible, so accountability is built in. Can truly replace request emails. It is probably the most complete freemium I've come across.","Cons: It is just tasks, and nothing more (as far as I've gotten). It lacks the ability to tackle projects from the beginning."

I was having a bit of trouble trying to figure out how exactly I was going to do this so I thought who else to ask other than the Asana team themselves? Once I got in touch with them, the Support team was incredibly helpful. Within a few hours they were in touch with me and informed me that someone was looking into my inquiry. They were extremely flexible with hours (I work in Amsterdam, while the Asana team is in the USA) and even moved a few appointments around to accommodate me with the time difference. After speaking on the phone to the support team, I had a very clear picture of what my best options were, and began to implement them. The next day I was sent a very detailed summary of our call, which was extremely helpful to have. Even after about a month, they checked in with me to see how everything was working and whether there were any issues I was having. I was so pleasantly surprised by Asana's Customer Service Team - they truly went above and beyond to help me and make sure that I was able to use their tool optimally to achieve what I wanted to. I have experienced no cons along the way so far, and in the event that I do have some trouble I feel extremely comfortable and confident in relying on this service to help.

The free version actually works if you have a maximum of 15 team members and can already do the basics. But, of course, you would want the features of the paid version which is a bit steep in terms of pricing.",22/8/2020,"Pros: It's built-in organization system for handling multiple projects is really helpful for our team. I love its tagging capability as it allows easier communication within the team. As well as its ability to create tracking boards and lists which are definitely lifesaver. I can easily sort my tasks by project and update the status of each and share with my team. The design is neat and intuitive (with learning curve). The animations and colorful calendar interface are refreshing for a work app. Amazing that it's got Chrome and Gmail plug-ins and has a great mobile version. It is also highly customizable, you can basically use it for anything that needs a team to collaborate on.","Cons: There is a slight learning curve in Asana before you can fully enjoy all of its functionality. There would be times that the search feature would act up and you can't seem to find what you're looking for. The major downside for me is the issue with the incredible amount of emails that I receive from the system. I frequently get email notifications about anything and everything. There are times that I would even get duplicates. I tried managing it via setting but it seems not working and I still get every update from the team or projects that are not even assigned to me. Also, the pricing is a bit steep."

The option of progress is very useful too, because in this way, is possible to measure and to know the workload of the agency. This is very important to give to the client estimated delivery times.","Cons: I think that the interface design could be better, specifically talking about the intuitivity. When you use a software is very important that there are no questions about what this button is for, or how I do that."

We have used this in my workplace as a trial period but we ultimately ended up going with another service. However, using Asana for the few days that I did was definitely a good experience.",Cons: What I like least about Asana is that it really doesn't add anything new to what is currently already out there. This is very similar to a lot of preexisting services geared towards project management and team collaboration. Monday.com would be a great example of one that is exactly like this and is often actually even the preferred version.

Users can upload graphics, categorize tasks according to bigger projects, and follow other people's tasks to stay up-to-date.",2/5/2019,"Pros: Asana streamlines everything. Where I was getting task assignments through 5+ outlets (and failing to keep track of 50%), Asana ensures that all tasks are in one place, sends me notifications on due dates, allows a one-stop-shop for all relevant information, and is generally such a life saver.","Cons: Notifications are automatically set to email users for every task, and for people who are unaware that there is a mobile app and only rely on the email notifications, Asana clutters inboxes and does not streamline work processes.

It features in-app communication, deadline tracking, delegation, and file attachment. The only thing I wish it did come with is a general organization calendar.

I can have a ""Project,"" then under that I'll have all the top-level tasks. But I can't see anything below top-level tasks.

It worked so well that I suggested to our CEO that the whole company should use it for interdepartmental project tracking. We upgraded to pro, but Asana does not have the exact feature that we need. The feature we are looking for is it has a project kick off based on a kick off date. Once it kicks off all the following project tasks' due dates will be based on X days after the kickoff date. When reaching out to customer service, they don't really have an answer for us or whether the feature is something that will be built in the future.

Our company has integrated Asana with Wufoo forms, which has allowed our clients to submit requests via our company portal, straight into Asana. I love Asana's capability to allow me to communicate back and forth with resources assigned in a project. Many of our resources travel and Asana allows my team to continue to communicate and share files via projects with ease when out of the office.

I am the creative director of a business that focuses heavily on the productivity of our design department. All of the designers use ASANA to keep track of tasks and deadlines. I use the tags and project name features to track data and trends for the month. The integration with other apps (specifically Velocity) is extremely helpful. The mobile app is awesome on the go although it is not the easiest platform from which to edit tasks. There a only a few drawbacks that come to mind. I would love more customization in the notification department. It would be nice to target notifications to certain tags and projects. It would also be great to add certain filters to tasks that would auto-populate tags based on subject lines from email submissions.,3/11/2016,,

I enjoy it because I am a list-maker. Completing a task is rewarding with the celebration feature and most of my complaints come from user-error, AE's not providing enough information or setting up a task in a weird way.",Cons: The only thing I can think of that would make Asana more productive for our company would be adding the ability to have more than one person assigned to any given project. Often times we work as teams and yes you can add others as followers but it isn't the same.

Great up-time. Good collaboration features and capabilities. Nice looking UI.,Cons: I often mistakenly create empty tasks because when you create a task and press enter it automatically starts another one so I have to click 3-4 times to delete that empty task. I wish pressing enter didn't start a new task.

My day is wrecked if I can't access it. I love the functionality as it exists, but I think there are still exciting improvements that can be made. For example -- one feature that would be endlessly helpful to our team is the ability to create a template that saves the spacing of due dates and could automatically populate those dates based on a final project launch date (ie. task a needs be be completed 1 week before launch, task b a week before that, etc). I think there could be a better processing space or more in app google app integration so that meeting notes could more flexibly be kept in projects (I find myself moving back and forth for some meetings).

This is a great app for teams.","Cons: The pricing seems a little high, though admittedly, we haven't used the higher-end features (so maybe the pricing would seem within reason if we needed those features, too).

After reviewing many of the options out there, we found that Asana met all the requirements that we'd written up before our search began. Ease of use, UI experience, speed, organization, multihoming (tasks in more than one project at once), integration, and discoverability were just some of the things on the list, all of which Asana was able to do. Asana is not perfect, of course. We miss things like subtasks showing as a part of tasks, some ISO compliance things that we have to work around, and fully-implemented project planning features like workloads and Gantt charts. But, it does so many things right that we don't mind missing a couple of things. And, as Asana is actively pushing development, many of the features we think would be nice suddenly pop up one day while we're working.

This could be due to not having good leadership and moderation of Asana and the projects being laid out, or it could have been the platform itself having a higher learning curve than we as a team had the patience for at the time.",16/10/2018,Pros: Asana's trendy design and potential capabilities is amazing! They have awesome support emails that come through to keep you cued in on what you can be doing to help the platform work for you. Its important to have a strong leader and moderator with Asana for it to be a successful platform for your team activity.,"Cons: For my team, Asana lead to a LOT of impersonal computer based communication. There were so many layers to Asana that we would be left saying, i assigned this to you here in this part of this platform to do over here in this platform. It was almost like we started treating each other like we were computers and not humans. The tone became passive aggressive and it got overwhelming fast! It was hard for us to discern as a small team who to involve on what without minor players in a project getting inundated with notifications OR having to fish through notifications to get the details they needed actually to see."

If you are a smaller company but too many to use the free option, it may be best to use another software."

I was impressed with how clearly they could lay out all of the project elements - tasks, responsible parties, progress. I also like being able to communicate within the program.",Cons: Not really anything to say here. I did not find anything about the software difficult to use. The only issue I ran into had to do with sending messages to others on the team. I couldn't tell when they got picked up.

This is a tool that most companies use for proj management, but we use to host 1:1s. It is quick and easy to add and remove tasks and can be used to help keep people accountable for weekly goals and metrics.",Cons: It seems like Asana hasn't built much in terms of features/function for organizing 1:1s. There is no way to see archived (or completed) tasks once they are clicked completed.

Also, the app has such limited functionality that it might as well not be used."

EASE of use is HUGE.,19/11/2019,Pros: The software is a lot cheaper to get implemented than Microsoft Project. It has a much easier to use interface than MS project and very easy to just jump in and start building out projects and teams and getting everyone involved.,Cons: Only CON is it is web-based so you will need an internet connection to update or continue working. If the internet goes down you will be down until that is resolved.

In other words, if you accidentally click you can't just click out - you have to go back into the blank task and delete it. I personally find this quite annoying...."

When working in a team being able to communicate on the app is a great feature.,"Cons: It can be hard to keep track of all the tasks of the project when working in teams that are too big. I would recommend working with teams of 15 people, maximum."

We adopted Asana, moving away from Basecamp and Trello, and found it to work extremely well for larger teams and fast paced projects.","Cons: Not much not to like. It's very easy to get good visibility across a project. Only technical dislike is that you can't easily see a timeline for subtasks, this would be very helpful if this was possible."

Between personal task boards, project task boards it is very confusing which one you are assigning a task to and then for the boards you have favorited the navigation has become really confusing in my opinion."
5958,5958 Asana,Asana,Amy T.,Associate,Facilities Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,,10,“Amazing Project Management Software”,"Overall: This software has been amazing and easy to use so far. It has organized my workday as well as my team member's workdays as well. There is no confusion regarding what we should be doing, and projects are now completed in a timely manner.",23/10/2019,Pros: I am currently using the free basic version of this software. Asana is easy to use and you're able to assign tasks to your team members so that they can see when the deadlines are. We use it to determine when certain tasks should be complete so that the projects are completed on time.,"Cons: I would like to see a way that we can prioritize tasks that are due on a single day. If you have multiple projects at once, it's hard to see which tasks need to be completed first."
5959,5959 Asana,Asana,Lynn S.,Coordinator,Education Management,2+ years,4,4,4,4,4,7,“Almost there.”,Overall: Although this is an awesome and at the top of my list - the lack of the perfect calendar integration held this app from being THE one.,12/2/2019,Pros: Asana has a great interface with a lot of options to be able to view your tasks the way that you want to view them. The collaboration features are smooth and efficient and the ability to easily slide your projects on a calendar to move and adjust due dates and start dates is an awesome feature.,Cons: In the search for the perfect task app - seamless Calendar integration was my prime objective. This only has one way sync and not immediate.

No onboarding is required, even for employees who haven't used the system or one like it in the past. Tiered pricing keeps the tech from being cost-prohibitive even for the smallest teams.","Cons: The simplicity can be a little too simple in the face of large projects if the setup isn't done just-so, but once you figure out how the organization works best for your teams, this really isn't a ""con"" at all."
5961,5961 Asana,Asana,Muhammad Syafiq Hanafee B.,Software Engineer,Human Resources,2+ years,4,5,4,,,7,“Beautifully Made”,,22/10/2019,,Cons: The description boxes do not conform to markdown syntax.

The free trial gives you enough to make a decision on spending the money for the full version or not.,31/1/2019,Pros: Asana makes it very easy to assign projects and tasks to yourself or other team members.,Cons: The prioritization of projects can be challenging. Some type of flow chart would help make this software better for large projects.

I feel this app helps me organize my business in a way that makes me feel good. I don't ever feel like I'm missing something or forgetting to do anything with this app.",Cons: I feel like they could add a couple better ways to group things together but I don't have very many complaints about it either way.

It helps organize our calendars and have everything in one place for quick access and review",15/10/2019,"Pros: The best productivity tool out there, to help your teams. Much more than a todo list.

If I was running the marketing team, I'd probably do my research and find a better project management solution.",8/10/2019,"Pros: When I started working at our company our marketing team had ~30 individuals, now that it's grown to a team of 60+ with multiple teams involved in one project, we needed a way to keep track of all of the projects on a quarterly basis and make it easy to hand-off project steps from one team to another. Asana has filled this need. It's form feature is also pretty slick.","Cons: Often there is way too much clutter in the interface. Really, I just care about my projects, but as my interface is littered with our entire marketing teams projects, most of which are not relevant to me and I'm not a part of. This can make it hard to see a birds eye view of everything I'm responsible for (rather than everything our entire marketing team is responsible for)."
5971,5971 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Consumer Goods,2+ years,5,3,4,,4,7,“Great Software to Keep On Task”,"Overall: This helps our company keep on task, especially because many employees work remotely.

It's easier for me to remember to follow up when other people are supposed to be taking part; instead of a project getting lost if someone else drops the ball.,4/5/2018,Pros: I like that projects can be separated so that individuals involved with different clients can be added without compromising other projects or privacy.,Cons: It's too easily to accidentally click and create an extra task (or maybe it's just a problem I have). I keep ending up with open/empty tasks. User error?

With Asana you can keep tracking and distribute activities with deadlines, organize files and assign tasks to people so every effort can deliver huge projects.","Cons: It's great for working with small groups, for larger teams it's a little difficult to manage and keep the progress. It should give you reports and dashboards to keep an eye on the whole project."

Working with teams in different countries this helped us see progress and needs across the project.,23/4/2018,Pros: I like the ease of use the software provides when working on small teams this software handles things tremendously well especially if your team is remotely located in different locales/timezones,Cons: The way everything that is done remains there and you can look at older things and have a nice wrap up of all work done on the project
5979,5979 Asana,Asana,Dmitry I.,ad,Internet,2+ years,4,5,4,,,7,“Nice to for team”,Overall:,7/10/2019,Pros: Asana is easy to use. Set up a project and then several tasks underneath. Then can assign these tasks to each team member. What is good is that everyone sees the flow of info and can review and pick up at any time.,Cons: The setup of the dashboard and some of the links are not that clear from the workflow view. It is some times hard to see what is next and where it is tied. And hard to find options to add tasks.

Great for small teams! ”,"Overall: It keeps everyone on the same page and it's super easy to use, even if you aren't tech savvy. I'd honestly say that Monday.com (formerly DaPulse) is still the better option but if you aren't looking into expanding your team drastically, Asana will do just fine. It's affordable, intuitive, and has a clear user face. For me its a 7 out of 10. And a good 7 at that! :)",5/4/2018,Pros: They have a wonderful free (basic) version of Asana for small businesses or projects. The interface is really easy to understand. It takes less than 10 minutes to setup and create users. It feels professional.,"Cons: The basic is limited so it kind of forces you to purchase the upgraded packages. They are a business to make money, afterall... That said, compared to DaPulse (now Monday.com), they fail in terms of customization. It's not even remotely comparable. However, that said, Asana is easier to use and considerably more affordable, even with their upgraded packages."

It is displayed in a very good way and I can also share each project with specific people or departments and this is great because everyone is pending to finish their work for the same purpose.,Cons: It does not have many functions and if you pay to obtain other features it is not worth it because they are very few.

If you mistype the project name, it creates a new project, and you loose your task since nobody is assigned to the new project.",26/12/2016,Pros: For three years it has been great for workflow management until now.,"Cons: Moving of tasks - with the recent decisions to remove features, makes me wonder what else they are going to remove rather than adding new things. Support has the same canned responses. Client contact by email from Asana needs improvement, you have to send a Asana request to the customer and have them sign up. So email threading with the client and staff is too many steps, it's easier just to send an email outside of asana."

Asana allows me to sort, visualise and delegate. It offers me a visual that is highly useful . And I have found it a great help in managing my team and myself.","Cons: I found it a little complicated to use at first as there are quite a lot of features.

Mobile functionality works well too. There are lots of options for task and team management. The sync between users or multiple devices is lightning fast.,"Cons: Despite it's clean interface, Asana is confusing to use at first. Sub-tasks can be assigned deadlines but these deadlines don't show in the main card view or send an alert to the assigned team member. Data shared within tasks automatically creates large task cover images, making it harder to read the team board. Perhaps most surprising, you can't enable the ""tags"" property by default nor can you edit the default property types you can assign to a task."

I think there's a lot of potential because it's a very powerful tool, just needs a few tune ups/additions.",5/3/2020,Pros: Asana is great to delegate tasks and collaborate with team members. Easy to use with a mostly clear interface. The comments section of the tasks is also very helpful.,Cons: The main issue is that there is no desktop app Mac/PC. Hinders the workflow to have to access the platform from the web every time. Also notifications then don't come through if there's no desktop app. The interface is a bit difficult to understand and actually see what tasks are outstanding. Since there are many different buckets and teams you can be on it would be helpful to have one place where everything is presented in an organized fashion with the ability to prioritize. I've also noticed that the interface hasn't changed in years so it could use an updating.

It is easy to create tasks for teams as well as private tasks. Additionally, the Tab+B Easter egg is also hilarious and is a great light-hearted addition to the software.","Cons: Inbox filtering would be a great addition, unfortunately the inbox is just filled with every post that comes through.

It's easy to access anywhere from both the app and the website. You can even integrate it into Slack. I love how interactive it can be between groups of people. It's easy to get clarification on task goals, and easy to mark progress. The reporting is surprisingly useful too. It's great to see when tasks are marked complete and by who.

Free version or not.,19/6/2018,Pros: I think Asana is basically the same almost in every way compared to Trello. I could go with either software program and be good with using either one . Important to me is that my projects can be put up on a board and all people involved with a specific project have access to the dashboard for notes and tasks that need to be completed. I could also access it when I am not at work from my cell which is awesome.,Cons: Similar to Trello I wish you could put up multiple dashboards each with their own projects and tasks assigned to them at the same time. But you could only post one project per dashboard with all its included tasks to be completed.

You pay in blocks of users instead of per-seat, which is not a great model for many use cases (such as freelancers or very small teams).

I essentially use the task view as a project to-do list and put my task notes and other details in the description box. I ignore the project feature completely and just work off the main tasks list view (using it as a project list view)."

Also, the new task design makes it harder to add projects and followers which is a bummer."
6491,6491 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,11-50 employees,2+ years,4,4,3,3,,,“Using free version: easy to learn and good option for teams who collaborate on projects frequently. ”,,15/5/2018,,Cons: Sometimes you can lose the task you created if you forget to assign or give a date it disappears and it can be difficult to find again. I'm using the free version so I think a lot of my smaller functionality complaints could be solved by opting to pay.

Efficiency gains are amazing.”,,9/5/2018,,Cons: The inability to toggle between board and list view. If this was available it would make both brainstorming and execution easier. We could simply brainstorm in board view and switch to list view for execution. The mapping between the two doesn't seem very difficult so not sure why the Asana team does not provide this.

6501,6501 Asana,Asana,Meiby P.,DOCENTE,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,4,3,4,8,“Good option to improve productivity”,"Overall: The best thing is that within the projects in the school, we can incorporate the parents as invited users in certain activities so that they observe the work, and in other projects that if we need more collaboration we assign another type of more active role for their participation. All this is only possible with ASANA.",30/3/2018,"Pros: The best of asana is its integration with other tools such as drobox or slack, this allows tasks and documents to be organized more easily. Asana is an excellent option when it comes to managing educational projects and assigning tasks in remote jobs since it allows registering and following the tasks of each user.","Cons: In its beginnings it had few functions but in the other updates they incorporated many options to improve the productivity in the equipment, generating schedules and progress of the pending and finished tasks."

But I think that's since been resolved,9/3/2018,"Pros: I love the interface, the ease of use, and what happens when you complete a task! A lot of thought went into this software, and it's obvious. I wanted this to be the #1 choice for my new team when we were moving away from Basecamp, but we ended up having a few more specific needs that Asana did not meet, but I still use it for my personal task management.

You can use it for all kinds of things. Personally, I have used it to track customer purchases, plan for project, a personal to do list, and also a reminder for key events.",Cons: There isn't much to dislike about Asana.

Half my team is located in different states and we use asana to keep focused. However, it is not intuitive enough and I find myself having to teach people how to use asana even if they have already been using it for a while. The biggest issue we have is that tasks and comments get lost very easily. The search feature is very low grade and my organization calls it... ""The black hole formally known as Asana.""

Even to delete a new task i had created on accident (by hitting enter) is easily deleted by just backspace. I use this to handle all of my regular tasks (ongoing/recurring) and adhoc (one-off) for all 8 clients and its a great way to overview how much is open for them. I wish I had this tool years ago",10/11/2016,"Pros: Easy to create new tasks , easy to assign to others or myself","Cons: viewing completed tasks, i wish i could see the full list of completed with non-completed"

6535,6535 Asana,Asana,Cole M.,Research Associate I,Chemicals,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,9,“Amazing platform for Team Communication”,"Overall: In all team environments, communication is key. The ease of posting, assigning tasks, etc. is amazing for the way our company works, and allows me to stay updated on other ongoing projects that I may or may not be involved in. The phone application is personally my favorite, and seems to work a little more smoothly than the web based application. The updates work great with my android and it is nice to be able to see what's going on without checking my computer constantly throughout the day if I'm at my workbench. I like that we can also create personal task lists that no one else can see, as this is a great way to organize your day in a task-based way; it helps me step back and take one thing at a time and leave notes to myself if I need them.",3/11/2016,Pros: Task-based organization,Cons: The web-application works a little poorly when minimized
6536,6536 Asana,Asana,Brandon R.,Producer,Retail,2+ years,4,2,4,2,3,7,"“Good, could be better”","Overall: Love all the features and abilities, but there are many areas that I'd improve. Copy/paste is not always effective. Most times you copy and paste in information the spacing gets all messed up. The other issue I have is that the hotkeys to do different actions are very abstract and hard to use.",3/11/2016,Pros: Ease of collaboration,Cons: copy/paste is bad. Hotkeys and actions are too tricky.

We work in sprints so organizing our projects into different sprints has been really helpful.,3/11/2016,Pros: Fairly easy to use. Keeps me organized and on track with my tasks for the day.,Cons: I believe there could be some more advanced features.
6538,6538 Asana,Asana,Chris T.,Finance Manager,Construction,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Game Changer”,Overall: It took us about 5 minutes of using Asana to realize that we have to roll it out to the whole company. We have been using it now for over a year and it is the basis of all of our workflow. We couldn't live without it.,3/11/2016,"Pros: Flexibility, you can organize the way you see fit.",Cons: I don't like that everyone is not on it. I would love to assign tasks to vendors and customers.
6539,6539 Asana,Asana,Catherine E.,Program Coordinator,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,4,4,5,5,10,“Asana for our online team”,"Overall: Asana has been great for our team. We are a small team working largely online from four different countries. Asana has significantly reduced the number of internal emails in our organisation. It is now easy to follow a project and to understand who in our team is contributing. It is easy for us to work together on a project despite being in different time zones. As soon as I open Asana I can see what information or tasks my colleagues need from me, this is very important as most of our team works part-time. By working in Asana I feel like we are achieving more because I can see the contributions my colleagues are making. I think we have also reduced confusion and double handling of tasks by having clear work flows. We can all now see how completing small tasks are important to our overall program goals.",3/11/2016,Pros: I like being able to break down large projects into smaller tasks and allocating them to the appropriate person.,Cons: I want to be able to search for tasks that we have already completed.
6540,6540 Asana,Asana,Caz O.,Account Executive,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,4,3,5,5,4,7,“Asana - great for medium-large teams to distribute tasks”,"Overall: We use Asana in several ways. I think it's most useful on big projects that have lots of people, in lots of time zones, needing to keep track on who is doing what. It's also a great personal to-do list. It's flexibility with tagging options, teams, etc. makes it very flexible.",3/11/2016,"Pros: Range of uses - almost everything I've ever wanted it to do, it does.","Cons: It's a bit confusing to start with, and hard to explain to new-starters. It's best to just use it and learn as you go. I'm sure there are tons of functions I don't know about."

The app is terrific.,Cons: Tasks can get 'buried'. Wish you could copy a task from one project to the next
6544,6544 Asana,Asana,Dave P.,,Unspecified,2+ years,5,3,5,,4,7,“Very Powerful Project/Task Management Application”,"Overall: I love Asana. I really do. An organization can set up teams, and each team can have a separate 'space' for conversations, calendar, and projects. Then, within each project, every task can receive comments, assignments to a team member, tags/labels, file attachments, and subtasks. Even the subtasks can receive comments and the ability to assign to a team member! The amount of granularity and segmentation is incredible. From a management perspective, simply clicking on a team member's icon will list that team member's remaining tasks. That feature is helpful to see what tasks are remaining on a project and who is responsible for those tasks. Will all that power and flexibility, there is a downside. At least, it's been a downside for our organization. Our employees don't fully utilize Asana because there is a bit of a steep learning curve. Asana does provide an extensive amount of documentation to help onboard your team, but, there is a significant time investment to fully go through the material. In short, Asana is incredibly powerful and can help you effectively track teams, projects, and tasks. There is a learning curve though, and if your staff/organization has no experience with project management software, the on boarding process may be laborious.",11/10/2016,,

I like to prioritize 'day', and then hand-pick the priorities for the day. The problem is that I have more tasks than I am able to get done, and when I fall behind it takes more effort to prioritize."

Product Marketing Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,4,4,5,,5,7,“So helpful when it comes to personal task management”,,1/9/2016,,"Cons: I don't find it easy to use for collaboration.

6547,6547 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4,4,,5,10,“Asana works for us!”,"Overall: Our small Marketing Department uses Asana daily to keep track of projects and deadlines. We use the free version but if it wasn't sufficient for our needs, we'd invest in the paid version.",29/8/2016,Pros: Free version User friendly Useful features I haven't had a need for customer support,Cons: I haven't experienced any.
6548,6548 Asana,Asana,Sean S.,,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,,5,,,“Asana Project & Task Management”,"Overall: Our nonprofit organization has tried more project & task management solution then I can even remember. Asana, however, is a remarkable project/task platform that is both affordable and rich in features that don't get in the way. Asana is more than just a project management solution, it's platform that enables users to create project/task templates that can be customized, and a workflow to keep things going, such as sending out reminders to team members about upcoming or late tasks. There is also a fairly large resource network where templates can be downloaded and/or purchased. We have used Asana for recording the minutes of board members, editorial scheduling and idea management. It has provided our organization with a powerful solution that is easy to use, and affordable.",21/12/2015,"Pros: There's a lot to love about Asana, so it's hard to single out anything specific.","Cons: The GUI is easy to get a handle on, but it can be somewhat overwhelming for new users. I would also suggest making it clearer to users that they have a personal & business dashboard."
6549,6549 Asana,Asana,Emma N.,Program Manager,Computer Software,2+ years,3,2.5,3,5,,7,“A powerful tool with major adoption issues”,,9/7/2015,,"Cons: If you (and the rest of your organization) can't commit to really investing in Asana, I've actually found that it's somewhat counterproductive. A real investment in Asana represents a major shift in the way users must consider their personal and collaborative tasks. I think there's some real wisdom in Asana's task management ideology, but I've found motivating myself and the rest of my org to adopt it consistently very challenging."
6550,6550 Asana,Asana,Tom M.,"Director, Data Management",Market Research,2+ years,5,4,4,,,9,“Great Tool for Workflow & Project Management”,"Overall: We had a slow onboarding / user adoption rate, but after getting the platform customized, it has become a great tool for the business.",29/9/2020,"Pros: Customization, alerts, dashboards, ability to create multiple projects and sub-tasks. Asana has become my go-to dashboard for project management.",Cons: User adoption can be a challenge; customizing the platform can also be difficult.

Another pro is that I can download the app for Slack so that I receive notifications and can take some actions in Slack directly. It's easy to use.","Cons: There is a limited amount of people that can be added to a project (for the free version), therefore you need to subscribe if you have a bigger team."

Theres a lot you can do with it but I feel like in my pursuit to get my work done I just never had time to play around with it enough to understand the complexities of how to use all the benefits.
6553,6553 Asana,Asana,Angela N.,Marketing Executive,Non-Profit Organization Management,2+ years,5,5,4,4,5,10,“Easy planning tool”,Overall: Asana has made it super easy to keep up with fellow team members as well as updating everyone easily with new information for campaigns.,5/8/2020,Pros: The user experience of Asana is simple to navigate and browse and sort through your daily and weekly tasks.,"Cons: There's not many cons with Asana, with the software team undertaking monthly upgrades.

6554,6554 Asana,Asana,Jeanette C.,Operator,Research,2+ years,4,5,4,,,7,“Easy to use + Track”,,29/7/2020,,"Cons: It probably more of a user error than Asana's fault, but a lot of people would forget to use it/let tasks build up despite having done them, so it gets complicated with trying to use it for accountability. Also might be helpful to be able to include links/more details in the todos, in case some steps need a lot fo explanation."
6555,6555 Asana,Asana,Ella D.,Travel Systems Manager,Consumer Services,2+ years,5,5,5,5,5,10,“Highly recommended ”,Overall: Very good and satisfied! I am very impressed with its features,21/7/2020,"Pros: I like all the functionality available. It gives you a clear overview of the task at hand, timeline and other details. I personally like the fact that you can assign a task to a member too and it notifies you via email",Cons: I cant think if anything that i dislike about this product. It really works for us and it highly recommend this

I use it for side projects.,14/7/2020,"Pros: Thanks to the subtasks feature Asana is a good tool to handle big tasks, making possibile to add description, attachments and comments inside each of them.",Cons: Its interface require some time to be fully understood and categorization of tasks is not enough visually understandable even using tags colors.
6557,6557 Asana,Asana,Nade K.,Admin Assistant and HR,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,4,,,7,“Our team use the tool on daily basis”,"Overall: I use it on weekly basis, to update my own tasks within the company or to just put in there future potential tasks. However, our team members are using it daily and it works greatly for them - specially for the customer service team and the operations manager. They can easily stay on track with all new products launches, promotions and daily activities.",6/7/2020,Pros: The integration with Slack - easy to write a message (task) on any Slack channel and with one click you can transfer it to your Asana boards as an official task.,"Cons: For me personally, it's vry subjective as I am used to use a competition tool on daily basis. So somehow I am used to that one rather than Asana."
6558,6558 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Publishing,2+ years,5,3,3,,3,5,“Great for Small Team Project Management”,Overall: It was helpful to start managing some projects better but overall didn't satisfy our larger project management needs.,13/5/2020,Pros: Asana is a great idea and tool for keeping teams on target and communicating. The calendar and reminder features in even their free version can make sure you don't forget about any aspect of a project. Great basic solution for small team project management.,Cons: The free version has a limited number of features and adjustable functions.Free is limited to only 15 teammates and has no timeline view. To truly get the most out of the program you need to upgrade to at least their Business level. To customize fields and have a true admin console you have to at least upgrade to premium. Their free version gives you a taste and is okay for small teams doing small projects.

Easy way for the clients to see status of their own project.","Cons: Wish there was a function to export and import to different Mac Apps, which doesn't have Asana integrations, but this ultimately does not fall on Asanas problem."

This helps us communicate these items and stay on task.,13/4/2020,"Pros: We use ASANA to communicate tasks, to dos and completions throughout our remote company. It is an awesome way to share and delegate.",Cons: It is hard to search and follow. We use it for all departments and have multiple boards.

Projects can be defined easily and will gain real oversight when done correctly.,"Cons: As a first time user, the number of buttons might be confusing. After working with the software for some time you'll be used to all its features and possibilities."

It would be helpful if it did was something like google calendars where you can set an event as one-time or recurring and it would just populate the rest of the year.
6566,6566 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Telecommunications,2+ years,5,5,4,4,4,8,“Great tool but limited options unless you purchase ”,Overall:,20/2/2020,"Pros: I loved being able to create multiple projects, assign tasks, and it's extremely user friendly - it's easy to learn and pick up quickly even for those who may not be the most tech savvy.","Cons: Customer support was very pushy to sell, sell, sell - which I definitely understand, but at the same time, I just had some simple questions about features - they kept trying to sell a whole package. They wouldn't really listen to my questions/concerns. That was a bit of a turn-off. Also, you really need to purchase in order to fully utilize it the way your business needs. If you're independent, it's fine."

Employees don't have to come to the office to find their tasks for today. If I'm not available I can still have our entire team organized and on task. I've even used this at home to help my family plan out and use their time more efficiently.,Cons: It does require that users regularly consult their tasks and not ignore what's been set up. If you aren't used to consulting a list or task manager it can take some getting used to.

But, once you are passed that phase, it is an amazing customizable team management tool.",8/12/2019,Pros: It is customizable in so many different ways. You can tailor it to the project requirement. The number of functions and its ability to integrate with other apps and services within it makes it extremely versatile and intelligent,"Cons: It is daunting to set the initial layout and structure of use for your team.

6579,6579 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Construction,2+ years,4,4,3,,,5,“A Probably-Brilliant Project Management Tool That Didn't Gel With Me (Or Vice Versa)”,"Overall: Asana was probably way more of a program than I needed, and my miniature requirements were probably ill-suited to the program. I'd hate for my review to stop anyone from trying Asana, as apparently many people find it excellent. For me, I found it had oodles of features I didn't use, and it became little more than a fabulously overpowered ToDo list.",17/10/2019,Pros: Asana is aesthetically beautiful and reputed to be wonderful. What I liked most about it was what I heard and thought before using it. That sounds like a vicious backhanded compliment; I don't mean it that way. I guess I just didn't really like anything very much about Asana.,"Cons: The whole application left me indifferent or even slightly repulsed. That sounds really harsh when I write it, but it's the truth. There's nothing wrong with the app, really, and I am prepared to accept that a large number of people/teams find it excellent. It probably is. For whatever reason, after trying it out for several weeks, I simply found myself wanting to avoid opening it. And that's not because I didn't want to do the work on the projects I was using it to manage-- on the contrary. And once I switched to a competing app that for whatever reason gelled with me, that was good."

I can throw anything in there, attach it to a task, make assignments to other team members, ask questions and check the progress of a task or project. Asana frees up my mind and keeps track of all my work so I can be more creative in my job. It's fantastic","Cons: I don't have any complaints about Asana, so far."

It's a great trello alternative and does a lot more too.,12/9/2019,"Pros: With Asana I'm able to manage each project separately, and Im able to create separate individual sub-task under each card, which is an impressive feature. It gets work done smoothly and without confusion. With the free version I'm able to manage entire team, allot projects to individual member and set due dates.","Cons: Image proofing feature on asana is pretty dull, I have to depend on other online tools like GoVisually to get image proofing done."

6587,6587 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,5,5,5,9,“Top Tier Task Management System”,,26/8/2019,,"Cons: - The UI is not the most seamless and will take some time for your team to understand. Once adapted to this software though, your team will likely succeed. - One other con is that you cannot assign tasks to multiple people from what I've seen, only multiple followers. I think this feature could be added"

6591,6591 Asana,Asana,Jordan C.,Salesforce Product Manager,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,5,10,“Awesome Project Management Tool”,"Overall: All teams were on Google Sheets or using Google Solution to work, synchronize. It was hard to synchronize all teams with that kind of solution. That's why we chose Asana, company-wide. Project management is way easier now, all teams can collaborate fast and update their tasks, in order to have a sharper overview.",2/8/2019,"Pros: Very easy-to-use, many features to organize Tasks, Timeline feature, Ressource management, Analytics","Cons: Nothing, I am fully satisfied of Asana.

It helps me keep my AP current.,"Cons: While the feature to message each other on a specific task is great, the ""chain"" gets confusing because it will sometimes be the oldest first and sometimes be oldest last. This may be something easily fixed that I just don't know how to do."

Now you can work only if the computer is connected to the Internet. We often have problems with the provider, so we lose time because we can not work. An offline client would help solve this problem."
6599,6599 Asana,Asana,Eszter A.,content manager,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,3,4,,,7,"“It's not you, it's me”","Overall: Since the partnership was also terminated, and with it, my use of Asana dwindled (I tried to use it afterwards within our own organization). It was mainly due to the people using it, and not the software itself. I feel like this is great for creativity oriented people, who need to use many words. I prefer to organize work in a few words, see a brief of everything at a glance. Asana isn't for me, despite being a great tool.",29/5/2019,"Pros: Asana was different from softwares I used before, and it felt like a step up. I loved the visual,and always felt that there was more to it than I saw.","Cons: But: it was implemented by a partner, who was trying to get our insight and report back with the tool - for that, Asana wasn't ideal - there was too much text, and too little functionality, it didn't feel all that different from emailing back and forth."

Not for quick and simple things, but for more robust projects.",23/4/2019,"Pros: The layers of features within Asana are really great. At first glance, it appears to be a fairly straightforward task management app. But when you begin to dig deeper, you realize that it has a very robust feature set that not only scales well but can expand to team use as well.","Cons: I've historically had a hard time sorting tasks. Custom views, as it were, are not really a thing."

When one person's expertise is needed, the card/page can be ""assigned"" to that team member, who then comments/edits, marks ""Complete"" and then sent on to the next person. Likewise, a project can be laid out by one person, step-by-step, task-by-task, ahead of time, with each task assigned to a specific team member, and the progress of the project can be easily tracked and reported.","Cons: It can be difficult to find past projects that have been marked ""Complete"" for references' sake. An ""Archived"" feature for such projects would be incredibly useful. At the time of this review, however, none exists."

It is really easy to use and simply for project planning and management. We can manage projects that follow a variety of different software development models like Waterfall model, Agile model and others. The overall user experience is pretty great but a long way to go as compared to other competitors in the market like JIRA and Azure DevOps.","Cons: Azure DevOps and JIRA have made a great name in the software industry and are way better in terms of the features they provide as compared to Asana. Presently, Asana is not a complete Application Lifecycle Management tool and is on its way there."
6609,6609 Asana,Asana,Preeti A.,student,Writing and Editing,2+ years,4,5,4,5,5,9,“Asana to simplify your work”,Overall: I loved the application as It helps me in planning all my work,7/4/2019,Pros: - Ease to create a task - Ease to assign the tasks - Ease to track the task,Cons: - Cannot add more than 1 user in free version - No version for non-company people who want to use the product for family chores

I love the design of the page because it facilitates and improves communication of the whole team, is easy to use and everyone will feel comfortable managing it.",Cons: I think it's an excellent application. I can't think of anything negative.

The UI is so easy to use, the first time I used it I wondered why I didn't have it before and now I can't live without it. My essential To-Do list.",26/3/2019,Pros: It's a powered up to-do list. Asana really brings the best out of tasks ahead and the notifications are really helpful. Being able to link people to it and attach documents is even easier. The platform is so intuitive it feels like a tool that's been around you forever.,Cons: Better documents previews. Sometimes two documents have the same name and teams have the need for a preview image before opening up a doc.

We have multiple members of our marketing team that use Asana for campaign management and it saves us all time from asking questions that we can just lookup on our own. It also helps avoid mistakes like doubling up on efforts, missing deadlines and helps cut a big project into smaller and more manageable pieces. Couldn't recommend Asana more.","Cons: Honestly, there aren't many. It's SO complex with so many features that I'd say the only downfall is how many functions you can accomplish. It's a bit of a learning curve to find your way around the platform but once you have your bearings, it changes your entire workflow for the better."

Sometimes I just like to write down a quick to do item while i'm on the run, but sometimes it's easier to just write it down in a reminders app than to create it in Asana. I have since found a work management software app that syncs to my reminders app, and it also integrates with siri so I can just tell siri things to add while driving."

Love being able to send from our email into our Asana lists. Definitely the tool we needed to get ourselves on track.,Cons: Easy to turn into a glorified to do list and to spend more time trying to manage and organize your list than getting things done. We had to create some rules and disciplines to keep things from becoming mercurial and redundant.

The interfaces are extremely intuitive, and getting new team members started is really quick and easy.",Cons: There are powerful features missing when you compare to something like Jira.

Now we can assign tasks and have team members follow tasks as the project progresses.",25/10/2018,"Pros: What I liked the MOST was the ease of use and that my whole team can stay ""in the loop"" with me.","Cons: Personally, I am the type of individual who prefers a more graphical interface, but that is just me and no reflection on this product."

I like the idea to keep the project on the left (like in the majority of the popular tools that I use) and that you can see the icons of your coworkers next to the tasks. The design is very clear and creating projects is very intuitive.,Cons: I think that creating a recurring task could be less confusing.

It's very straight forward yet powerful enough to create gant charts to see project progress timelines. It is honestly the best task management tool I've ever used. I've never used any other tool that groups sub asks as well as Asana does - that's so important for projects that involve many people and many departments.,Cons: The only reason why our company decided to move away from Asana was because it's not as easy to sync to our CRM as well as Zoho or Salesforce does since it's all in one product.

However, it isn't a very good defect tracking system. While you can set it up with various rules, all of it feels like a cludge when working on a technical level.",3/10/2018,"Pros: Asana is a great way, I suppose, to organize a team in the design phases. It's very simple to use, and as a web based product you can pop on and monitor progress from just about anywhere. It has a great uptime, I don't think I've ever seen an outage with Asana, and I've been using it for about 2 years.","Cons: The software just doesn't fit the technical side of the team. Pasting in code snippets just isn't there. Defect tracking is not a good choice either. It feels like this is more for designers and project managers, but it just misses too many issues to replace tools like JIRA or Bugzilla. For that it would need to integrate with Github, have code snippet pasting with syntax highlighting."

I really like being able to see at the projects and targets at the same time and also the collaboration options are fantastic with Asana,Cons: The cost for a small team is a littlw high but I suppose if you're using the toll well it will be saving you money in the long run.

In my opinion, very useful for teams up to around 50 people.","Cons: Sometimes I find Asana a bit confusing with all the functionality, the calendar, the tags, the boards, etc. But when you get used to it - it all makes sense and becomes very useful!"

Keeping track of project tasks is a lot easier and all my projects are in one place.,5/8/2018,"Pros: I use Asana for my own personal use and our company Marketing team uses the free version of Asana.

It is fairly intuitive. Has good customer support when I had a question.,Cons: No chat.

While the free version does not have a whole lot of functions, I don't need it for that. I needed something to help me stay on top of my tasks and Asana does just that."

I am using the free version and tried a few other similar services out. Asana seems to have the most features for their free version and their paid version seems to have some really neat features to it.,20/1/2020,"Pros: Since my team is small and a startup, we are using the free service, which still has plenty of features. The system is easy to use and has a nice clean layout and design. This software works great for monitoring and working on projects of all sizes. The web-based software has many different integrations you can tie to it and you can enter unlimited tasks and subtasks.",Cons: The paid version can become pricing depending on your team size. I also wish that the software came with more metrics and reports.

It has the functionality for assigning subtasks to different team members in your organization and provides visibility to when things have been completed. There is also a timeline function so that you can visually see what you have coming up.,"Cons: I wish there was a way with Asana to integrate easier into your desktop or other applications, including Gmail to quickly create tasks without having to manually do so in their platform."

It is easy to use and works for multiple project management styles.

6765,6765 Asana,Asana,Vuk P.,Freelancer,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,3,3,4,,,3,“It's just very ugly”,"Overall: Asana is just another tool that really doesn't help in streamlining the process. I have to use it on projects, and I would honestly prefer a simple shared online spreadsheet. It's just so not user intuitive. The only good thing about it is that if something is late, you can shift the blame on someone who is in charge of the task, which is why I suppose business managers like it. It helps them to keep track of people's activities and investment in the project.",29/10/2019,Pros: It has a smart way of sending out timely notifications and doesn't remind you after you are overdue on a task for 3 or more days. It just stops bothering you then.,"Cons: The icons are small, tasks are hard to get around, finding closed tasks is very much a pain unless you know their exact names. It's just not pretty visually."

Other tools we've looked it do not offer us that flexibility in building our lists, which vary greatly between different projects.","Cons: I feel like this software could be easier to use. For one, there is not free desktop app for Macs, and we sometimes forget to keep the tab open all day. It's also a bit ticky to create new tasks. The only way I've found how to do it is to go on an existing task and typing ""Enter"", which is counter-intuitive compared to other productivity tools I've used."

Once I was sick of Proofhub, we came back to Asana and use it for all project managements.",24/8/2019,"Pros: Everything is easy to use. The app they offer for iOS and Android is as good as the web platform. Managing projects is easy, not much to understand about it, just get started and get going",Cons: Loading time; The web version takes any time between 30 seconds and 5 minutes to load. Its the most irritating thing about it. The smartphone apps don't have this issue.

It works well and does what you need it to do.,20/8/2019,"Pros: It is really good for collaborating on projects. And its pretty flexible in how you use it or what kind of project you are working with. You can assign tasks to users, exchange files and comments and keep track of progress with minimal fuss.

We primarily used this on my team to maintain a to do list of actionable items discussed during our meeting and split up work by assigning it to ourselves or others.,"Cons: Perhaps it's that I don't have a background in project management, but it wasn't clear to me what else I could use Asana for until I saw a colleague do something cool with it. It also wasn't clear where or how I could find it use additional features and I often got lost in menus and workspaces. I will caveat that with the fact that I didn't look very hard for these options or ask for help from Asana - within the limited scope I was using it, Asana overall worked great for me."

I don't dislike it. But, I felt like it wasn't as intuitive as it could have been when I first started using it. And, the dashboard was not my favorite.

As our company grows we can expand to further functionality of the software. As with any tracking software, it's only as good as what you put in.

It's really important to have the team's cooperation and buy-in with any tracking software you might use.",9/10/2018,"Pros: We are using the free version which has some limitations but even so, we are able to track our projects sufficiently to handle the tasks we have.","Cons: the task/comments editor is pretty limited.

For some of my projects, I definitely prefer one over the other. I also like how you can assign subtasks as well as tasks to other people. Its flexibility and its myriad of features are what keeps me using it.","Cons: I don't like how you cannot assign tasks to multiple users.

The fact that you cannot add more people to accomplish one task is very irritating as some tasks require more than one person.

New features are coming in to make Asana functional for a wide variety of users. The interface is easy to understand, and exceptionally easy to use. We were able to train co-workers quickly on how to use the platform.","Cons: The search functionality is useful, but it is limited to paid versions. Without the search functionality , there is a risk of creating tasks that can fall into an ""abyss."" When creating a task, you need to make sure to assign a user and project. Otherwise, it becomes a free-floating task assigned to nobody. Making this mistake is easy, and it costs us time."

I really like the app, they adapted it really well to the main flow.","Cons: After all the advertising that I have seen for it, when I finally used it, it was a mere disappointment. It didnt really change the way I work, I didnt see any difference but what I noticed was that I missed my deadlines. While it tries to give you flexibility you get lost. It is very messy, tasks disappear if they are done but this is horrible when you need to manage progress. Basic canvas doesnt fulfill the canvas approach and it is useless.

Where I feel areas of improvement could be made, would be: linking outlook to asana, as it can be confusing working between both platforms and assigning more then one user to a task. OUTLOOK: I currently use both outlook and asana as a delegating and tasking system. If there is a possibility that both platforms could be linked, would be amazing! MULTIPLE TASKING: The current feature at the moment is annoying, purely because it duplicates the users and looks messy. I believe if you introduce a pie system this would be amazing. I see it working as, 1) you assign multiple personal as norm but it creates a pie and each slice is an assignee. 2) you can hover over the pie to see who is assigned to the task at hand and once their part is completed, you can view completed date and time. 3) Once all have completed their task, it either disappears or changes gold to indicate to the group all assignee's have completed this is task and the project manger can sign off on it. Other than those two elements, ASANA is great",3/11/2016,,

Yellow stickies are an easy option, but going paperless was the way our team needed to go. Creating tasks, checking them off, and assigning dates are all very easy.

For an individual, Asana gives me what most other top of the line task managers give me (todoist, nirvana, etc.) - folders, projects, tags, searches, mail-in inbox, etc. Plus it has sync with Skedpal which nobody else has.

I already have 2 task management systems (Skedpal and Asana) but I have to have a third (Todoist or Keep) if I want location-based reminders
6998,6998 Asana,Asana,Denise S.,Writer,Writing and Editing,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“Great Organizing Tool for Remote Workers”,Overall: I use Asana to communicate with a writing client. This is the platform where he leaves me notes about a project and I submit my work to him.,3/10/2018,"Pros: Asana is simple to use. When you are working on a project, it appears on your homepage for you to open up the workspace. You can upload almost any type of file, so you don't have to email them or share links through your cloud space. It really is a great place to collaborate with your collegauges or clients. You can open the project you're on and you see all the interaction between everyone working on the project so there is no need to go back through mountains of emails to find out who said what about a certain part.","Cons: My biggest problem with Asana is the limitations I have when uploading a folder. Yes, I can share with Dropbox, but I don't use their service. I tried sharing a large folder of images through Google Drive and ran into issues trying to share the file. In the end, I shared the link to the folder in the communication with my client. He seemed to still be able to access the file just fine."

I also love that I can make a specific hot link within a list to another item in the same list for reference.,Cons: Nothing! It is an awesome product and it has notably increased my own productivity and accountability.
7002,7002 Asana,Asana,Gordon P.,Owner,Internet,2+ years,4,4,4,,,7,“Great for project management”,,24/9/2018,,"Cons: The system continues to add new features.

I thought I was functionally against project management software because it didn't do anything a well organized Outlook couldn't. However, the ease of task assignment, the calendar and timeline views, and, honestly, the visual pleasure in using it has made Asana the new thing my team keeps constantly open.","Cons: There's still a learning curve to the high level functionality, but if there's something I wonder if Asana can do, it's pretty easy to google and find someone who has already figured out how to do it."

7005,7005 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Marketing and Advertising,2+ years,5,4,3,,5,6,"“Helpful, But Could Be Better”","Overall: It's good for communication between teams, but not ideal. While it is in my top five, this is not my first choice for project/task management software.",6/9/2018,Pros: I like that tasks can be dragged to different boards and that it has an inbox feature where notifications can be checked off. The ability to use subtasks and assign individual due dates to subtasks is very helpful.,"Cons: It's not as intuitive as some other softwares. Onboarding our staff was a little confusing because there is not a way to group boards together for easy access. There is simply a list of boards on the left-hand side of the screen. Overall, I feel the app could benefit from a more streamlined design. The more intuitive to understand, the more likely I will be to use it."

The notifications work really well, as well as the reminders of when something is due","Cons: It's difficult to access completed tasks, and I also find that entering a new task is not intuitive. It doesn't keep me organized, but that's just my preference/thought processes for staying on top of things. I bet it works great for some people."

A lot of people do not use Asana so I have to teach them about it before they just jump in.

So far the functionality has been a huge timesaver for my team and I. In addition, the ability to assign projects and followers has eliminated the need to send emails and check on progress via email. Instead, the completion tracking is all done within Asana. I plan to start using Asana for additional projects as we grow more accustomed to the tools.","Cons: If you're not used to project management software, some of the functionality can seem intimidating. In addition, setting up the templates will take time early on, but is necessary if you have similar projects throughout the course of the year."
7013,7013 Asana,Asana,Daniel C.,CTO,Unspecified,2+ years,5,5,5,3,3,8,“Great user experience”,Overall: The benefits that I got from this software was for project management and also tracking tasks of my employees,11/7/2018,"Pros: I liked the ease of creating new projects and managing tasks. It was very easy to add tasks, assign people to them, and archive the tasks that have been done each week all on the free version. There is also a panel for each person with the list of tasks assigned to themselves.","Cons: The thing I liked least about the software was that as the project count increased, I was spending more time checking tasks and organizing rather than doing work."

I can easily select which project I'd like to add or remove my task from. From there, I like that I can easily add a due date, sub-area, etc. The app is also crisp and extremely user-friendly.","Cons: I do not like that when a user presses ""enter"", Asana automatically creates a new task opening. Enter also solidifies the task on the list so it can be frustrating when it keeps creating new task lines. This makes my lists look more unorganized and then I'll spend time searching for the ""delete""."
7015,7015 Asana,Asana,Kayla B.,Marketing,11-50 employees,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“Asana”,,21/6/2018,,"Cons: The biggest problem I have run into when using Asana is that if you have many projects and tasking going on it is easy to get lost in it. Having a way to search for a certain item would help. Also the documents cant be edited and do not synchronize so you must download, edit, and then send back."

I was able to learn and start implementing a good portion of the features within about 30 minutes of signing up. Love the fact it's free for basic use. The flying unicorns after completing tasks is a nice touch also.,"Cons: Nothing to NOT like really. For all you get with the free version - it really is a great product! Tons and tons of great features (i.e. Gantt chart, TimeTracker, file storage, etc.)"

7023,7023 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,4,,,8,“We use Asana as a project management tool”,,12/4/2018,,Cons: I don't think it's quite as intuitive to navigate as it should/could be. I find that I will click through about 2-3 places sometimes trying to find one landing page. This might become easier as I use it more but it's not instantly intuitive which you might expect for software like this.

I'd rather the completed tasks stay opaque in the list instead of disappearing completely and only reappearing after being selected in the drop down menu. My boss just couldn't catch on to how to oversee which of my tasks were in progress vs. completed without me having to make separate columns for ""in progress"" and ""complete"". I'd rather both those categories be under one project, but easier to visualize."

Whilst some areas are intuitive, others are really hard work. Whilst the flexibility of formats can be useful, can make it difficult to maintain consistency across different teams. It would have been nice to have some standard templates to deal with weekly/monthly tasks using standard naming like business week numbers or month names - instead you have to create and then duplicate them, and then alter them one by one - which is painful."

It took me a while to figure it out. It's not super intuitive. Sometimes, it's hard to find tasks that are assigned to me. If I click on the tasks under my personal tasks, it doesn't take me to the project so I can't see any notes or documents attached. I then have to search for the actual project in order to get to the assigned task. I'm also not able to drag and drop tasks to other projects. (Again, this may not be the case with the paid option.)"

I often waste time with the update screen and when I do leave the tab open, which is rare these days, I'm greeted with a time-out message."

7057,7057 Asana,Asana,Tommy B.,IT Director,Computer Software,2+ years,4,4.5,3,,4.5,7,“It is so simple anyone can use it”,,9/9/2016,,"Cons: At the end of the day, it's a task management platform. If you like working with tasks, it's fine! I manage my project in a more legacy/classical ways. It is NOT MS Project"
7058,7058 Asana,Asana,Amy H.,Customer service,Computer Software,2+ years,4,3,5,,,9,“Asana is organizational heaven!”,,22/7/2015,,"Cons: It was pretty difficult to understand at first.

There are sometimes important notes in the comment section of specific tasks that are marked as completed even though the comments are still relevant to current business.

It can be awkward when someone assigns you a task from a project you are not actively involved in."
7060,7060 Asana,Asana,Ashley S.,Installation Project Coordinator,Unspecified,2+ years,4,4,,,,,“Asana has greatly enhanced the organization of our software implementations.”,"Overall: Asana has made interdepartmental work much easier to manage. In our environment most of our projects involve multiple teams to get a product implemented. Prior to Asana, things were falling through the cracks and overlooked. There are so many moving parts and we used to work based off excel project plans that are not interactive. Having interactive project plans that numerous people can access and modify has made it so we know exactly what needs to get accomplished and when. Of course like all products, there are some changes that would enhance our internal processes. Not all of our projects are linear, for example our design team is working on forms that I need to manage the process of while we are also organizing installations efforts. If there was a way to make it so more than one process can be created within the same project plan, that would be helpful. Also, sometimes we have a group that is responsible for one set type of tasks. Being able t o assign one task to multiple people would make this a lot easier to manage for us.",8/5/2015,,

It's extremely easy to customize and has some helpful templates to get you started. Even if you've never used project management software before, Asana is very intuitive.","Cons: Asana's default email updates about projects are a little much. These settings can be adjusted.

You can easily write comments on the tasks and indicate when they are done by moving them to another column.","Cons: I tried to use the ""conversation"" feature, but I could not figure out how to indicate they were done and permanently remove them. They continued to appear there and it was hard to keep track of things. Also frustrating that tasks do not order themselves according to priority--I have to manually move them around."

We group tasks under projects and sub headings within projects and this ties in to the structure of our business.,"Cons: If tasks aren't assigned to a project they can be very hard to find and searching for project titles is hard as there is no drop down, you have to manually start typing a project name and this can be difficult if you have set up a lot of projects, so can be time consuming."

The interface is super intuitive and assigning and working on tasks feels very natural.

Really, the product was centered on individual task management. Tasks could be assigned to employees or groups, and then it was up to those employees or groups to manage each item. As far as that goes, it was about par.",Cons: The list-style structure of the platform made task management virtually no more dynamic than using Google Keep. The sharing feature functionality was lacking. It never felt like employees were collaborating so much as stepping on one another's toes. The product is more of a blank sketchbook. There wasn't enough built-in accountability. And the file sharing system was too clunky for us to want to host anything in there.
7097,7097 Asana,Asana,Jenna J.,Social Media Marketing Intern,Food Production,2+ years,5,4,5,4,5,8,“Productivity FTW”,"Overall: Isn't the most intuitive platform at first, but has many tools to collaborate and be productive.",24/9/2019,"Pros: Once you get the hang of things, great productivity tool.

7099,7099 Asana,Asana,Verified Reviewer,,Information Technology and Services,2+ years,5,5,5,,,9,“One of the most comprehensive project management platforms”,,18/9/2019,,Cons: Tasks must specify one team member to complete the assigned task.

7100,7100 Asana,Asana,Aviva R.,COO,Civic & Social Organization,2+ years,3,2,2,,,2,“Surprisingly unintuitive and missing key features of other software ”,,15/9/2019,,"Cons: After working with Asana for over two years our entire team is ready to switch. There are just some UI things that seem obvious but don't work. When you create a task you can't add subtasks without clicking into it once again. But how do you find it to click into? It appears in the bottom left-hand corner for a couple of seconds and then disappears into the ether. Compared to other software, there are a bunch of other features missing, like the ability to switch a board from Kanban to a list (seems like a no-brainer) and general functionality around dependies, Gaant charts, and the like. Plus it just looks cluttered and hard to look at."
7101,7101 Asana,Asana,Abbey H.,Development and Communications Manager,Hospital & Health Care,2+ years,4,4,4,,,10,“I loved using Asana”,Overall: It helps with teamwork and with making sure all tasks are assigned to someone.,12/9/2019,"Pros: It really appealed to my sense of organizing, as well as being able to assign people things and then have it off my plate.",Cons: I wish we were using it at my current organization!

It helped us improve a lot and manage better our time.,10/9/2019,"Pros: I found this platform super useful for small teams, you can easily assign taks, check on the progress and always know what was completed and what needs to be done. It is pretty easy to use, though when you start you will need to take some time to set everything right and choose the functions and templates that will work better for your team.",Cons: I think there is space to improve a lot still. For example assigning a task to several people or being able to track the time spend in each task.

I like that you get notifications of tasks when they are assigned to you, when these are close to the due date, and also when you have overdue tasks, so you never lose the attention of the priorities.","Cons: The app could be made more intuitive by adding some tooltips, or maybe a short introductory tutorial."

It's clean, easy to use, not invasive, if anything maybe it's too simple for my taste, but as a side app to my main app for communication and tasking i think it's ok."

However, I do not use it to keep my daily tasks caught up with.",22/2/2019,Pros: I love the different projects that can be managed within Asana. Being able to collaborate with team members on the same project alleviates the need for so many emails as well.,"Cons: The reminders are not nearly aggressive enough for someone like me. I may say I need to do a task at a certain time but when that time comes around, it may no longer be the best time to actually do the task it's reminding me about. So a snooze of some sort would be better. And the default notifications being midnight on anything that doesn't have a time set is not helpful at all."

These are things that I need to track and list over longer periods of time, instead of my daily tasks.",27/1/2019,"Pros: I like that I can make as many projects as I want, with as many tasks as I want. I can schedule them for certain dates, or make them recurring as I often do for monthly admin tasks. I can also invite people to projects, post links, images or resources, and can categorize everything into sections.","Cons: There are a few features that I wish Asana had, like scheduling a project over multiple days or weeks, or putting in vacation time. But in that regard, I think I'm trying to use Asana like a calendar and I'm not sure it's meant for that purpose."

I was part of an Asana group while working for a biomedical company. It was a great way to manage multiple projects at once.,"Cons: It's not a full fledged project management tool, so there aren't any pretty visuals. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but for some businesses that can make a huge difference. Their timeline feature (which was introduced after the founder of the company passed away and I was no longer a regular Asana user) is a step forward, but it's still not quite - for lack of a less ridiculous phrase - Kanban compliant. :-)"

I would like it if the creators comments was in one color or shadowed and the team member have a different color for their comment section. When leading a large team and different businesses, any thing helps to differentiate communication and who is writing it visually."

The most useful characteristic is the activity or task prioritization, this way you can choose in what part of the board (can be customized) it will fall into. Also, you can add different team members or whole teams to be part of the tasks which can be really helpful specially if everybody uses the comment section for each task.",Cons: It can be hard to get used to all the mechanics at first but then it feels really smooth.
